I would cry seeing photos of me being happy because I knew I wasn‚Äôt the same person I was before. My passions have vanished, and I felt like a shell of who I used to be. I have done almost 20 meditations so far. I am learning a new skill which is helping me learn how to stop my (negative/anxious) thoughts, and stories I tell myself (which never happen), and I just listen to the woman talk and follow her directions in regard to where my attention should be. The sleep meditations have me asleep before she gets deep into the story with is only 15 minutes long! I am starting to finally feel like I am not suffocating in my life and can breathe again... Thank you...","Hello, we are all in a very chaotic time with a lot of uncertainty. Life is always full of ups and downs. Our feelings are temporary as everything else in life. Awareness and acceptance of this feelings may create bigger differences in ourselves than we ever expected. Reading your story was really heart-warming. Thanks for sharing with us!

1,2020-07-09 10:01:22,5,"This app has brought a new meaning of gratitude. I have come to a place of learning what works for my life and what does not. This Meditopia app has assisted me in my transition of change with a peace of mind and heart for the greater good of my sanity/health. I was once a Christian who never left out of the prism‚Äôs of her mind. Placing restrictions on God himself with religion. I receive the healing the universe has to offer. I have awaken my spirit to live and not suffocate and die. To release negative energy and to focus on positive energy. Meditation through meditopia is one of Gods greatest gift to  regenerate our very being of existence from our head to the very souls of our feet (like regenerating a cell). I had forgotten the basics the simplicity of health and wellness, so I encourage people to use the Meditopia app!","Hello, thank you so much for profoundly sharing this amazing experience with us.

2,2020-06-17 03:15:08,5,"Never in 1 million years did I think I would meditate, I didn‚Äôt even know what meditation was. This app was recommended to me by a coworker, I have always been a little bit high strung and it was starting to affect my health relationships and even work performance. Reluctantly I sat down listen to the lady on the app and followed along long story short, I have not missed a day in the past 5 months, I meditate daily, my life has improved drastically in all parts. Health, relationships with others and work performance,And I attribute a lot of that to finding this app and doing the work that is recommended it was an accident that I found it but I am glad I did thank you made it over yet","What a profound comment!

3,2020-08-02 13:45:00,5,"I‚Äôve used three or four of the other popular meditation apps, and found one or two to be very helpful. For example, Headspace was responsible for helping me establish a regular 10 minute per day practice that I have maintained faithfully every day for the past five years. 

I supplemented my meditation with other apps from time to time. And recently I discovered Meditopia. I like this app best of all. Mostly because of the combination of soothing music that has a special quality I‚Äôve not found elsewhere, and the quality of the woman‚Äôs voice that guides the meditation. 

There‚Äôs something about the blend of music, voice, and the words she uses, that make this meditation the most enjoyable and most relaxing of all the apps I‚Äôve tried. 

So there several really good ones, but this is the best in my opinion. Of course, my opinion is just one perspective. You‚Äôd have to try it and come to your own conclusions based on your unique preferences. 

But, if you‚Äôre looking for a good meditation app to try, this one is worth checking out for sure.","Hello Ernie, thank you so much for this uplifting comment! As an experienced user in meditation apps, your views are really valuable for us. Meditation is a very personal/unique experience and it is not always easy to find what works best for you.

4,2020-03-03 12:07:14,5,I work night shift and on my days off it‚Äôs very hard for me to fall asleep before 6 am. I found this app last week & tried the free sounds they really knocked me out within like 5 minutes. I did pay for the upgrade so I could get a variety of sounds and not play the same ones over but so far it‚Äôs my own type of melatonin. I stopped taking melatonin a few months ago and this has been a life saver. I passed it on to some fellow night shift nurses so hopefully they‚Äôll have the same experience as I did.,"Hello, it is great to hear that you liked Meditopia.

17,2020-03-24 22:37:55,1,"This seems probably a personal preference, but I find the female voice pretty disturbing and at times even creepy and unsettling.
I find this somehow relates to sexism and gender bias in machine/ human-imitating voices like with Echo, Alexa, Siri for instance, that somehow female voices are assumed to be more soothing, therapeutic, servient, helpful etc. - it‚Äôs not. 
I just don‚Äôt understand why there isn‚Äôt a male version to all the wonderful audios that I‚Äôm listening to with their wonderful content. Or even, a variety of voices from where I can choose.

Este a√±o ha sido el m√°s complicado en mi vida, el m√°s doloroso y el de mayor iluminaci√≥n tambi√©n. Y es aqu√≠, en la iluminaci√≥n, donde entra el protagonismo de esta app.
He empezado mi camino de despertar de consciencia y llegu√© hasta aqu√≠ gracias a un canal de YouTube.
Es muy completa. Hace un par de d√≠as pensaba que solamente ten√≠a algo en contra, el alto volumen del sonido de fondo de la naturaleza. Entonces empec√© a revisar las funciones y me di cuenta de que ese volumen puede ser ajustado al nivel deseado. Cuando encontr√© la opci√≥n de regular el volumen fue como mi momento ‚ÄúEureka‚Äù. Y ahora puedo decirlo alto y claro: es una app PERFECTA.
Mi √∫nica recomendaci√≥n, en cuanto a contenido, es que incluyan, de ser posible, meditaciones para sanar el ni√±o interior. Es un paso fundamental para el crecimiento y desarrollo espiritual, pues todos tenemos bloqueos que sanar en esa √°rea.
Les felicito mucho por Meditopia, incluye todo lo necesario para este viaje de encontrarse a uno mismo.
