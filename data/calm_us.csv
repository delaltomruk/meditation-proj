0,2020-12-06 05:17:39,5,"I updated the calm app and just out of curiosity I read some of the reviews.  I have been using the app for a while off and on, and love it.  I was curious what other people thought, and I don’t understand the critical apps.  Most are complaining that there is ‘no free content’ and you have to pay to get anything.  So I looked at the website without logging in just to see, since I’ve been a paying customer for several years.  Nothing personal reviewers, but that’s just not so.  There are at least 4 series that you can do, some of which I’ve done and found very good.  There are a smattering of sleep stories, some music, and I gave up after looking at master class and finding them all unlocked.  Yeah, there is a lot that is locked, but there is more than enough to get the experience, and no reason to look at it and say it stresses you out because it’s all behind a paywall like so many of the critical reviews say.  

It’s a very well done app.  I’ve been using it for several years and still have barely scratched the surface of what’s available, and there’s always new stuff, and a new daily calm every day.  Yeah... it costs a bit, but it averages out to about 5 dollars a month, and you never run out of content, and it’s good quality.  Isn’t that worth it?  I think so."
1,2020-09-21 22:38:20,3,"I really don’t like how you have to pay to get good stuff. That makes me stressed which takes away the purpose of the app Calm. Now, I understand that, with all of the items this app has, it has to cost money, but maybe, you could make more stuff free, like maybe a seven day program or something. Maybe that would hook more users and convince them to pay for the rest. Just a thought. Without paying, the only things you really can do are the daily check ins, the little reflection thing, and a timed meditation. Once someone gets bored of that, they’ll probably delete the app. You need a better way to get their attention. For example, I got the Sleep Cycle app, and I am very happy about it. It does have things that cost money, but not nearly as much money, or as many things that need money as Calm does. Most of the things in Calm cost a lot of money, and the things that are free are the things that aren’t the most helpful. Maybe this is an advertisement tactic? I’m not sure. However, in the Sleep Cycle app, the only thing that costs money is the Statistics which, honestly, I probably wouldn’t use that much. Also, it’s a lot cheaper. The things you can do without money are really cool; download the app to check it out! Over all, I have to give Calm three stars because of this, and it’s not just because it costs money, but also because of the amount of things that cost money and how much it costs. 

                         Sincerely, your local Calm user"
2,2020-12-08 16:02:24,3,"I just wanted to leave a recommendation.  There was an ad I got where you seemed to be walking down a hall that always turned right.  The walls seemed really close on both sides.  That is terrifying.  In fact, people purposely do that in horror games to create terror.  Just want to let you know, and this is coming from a psychology student.  I seriously thought something was gonna pop out at me and when I heard it was an app called “Calm” I was worried you guys knew nothing of the sort.  Terror is suspense, terror is build-up and a feeling that something is there.     That’s what makes good horror games.  But not an ad to help with anxiety, I can tell you that much.  It made me so scared!  Haha.
When I checked your app, I loved the aura.  I loved the colors.  But I also have to say this.  If you’re gonna add all these extra expenses, just put it out for that amount.  If you make this downloadable on different consoles and platforms, you have more excuses to put it out for an amount too.  Some consoles and platforms have all their apps at an expense.  I can appreciate your business and understand if you want a profit (who doesn’t.). Just, being up-front is better than saying “Unlock this app you just downloaded” basically.
I know nothing of business, though.  I just know that I’m cheap.  The free trial is a good idea, but understand people have other options, and everyone is struggling during this time with money, too."
3,2020-04-11 13:11:09,5,"I absolutely love love love this app!!!!♥️ once I could not go to sleep so I turned on some of the calm music and I fell asleep 10 minutes later. I was amazed. I have been getting better sleep since than. Also whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious about someone or something, I listen to one of the daily calms or the next day on the meditation trial. Right away it’s as if you were brought into some beautiful relaxing world where there are these voices saying “It will be ok no matter what. This will pass.” And it does its amazing how calming and peaceful this app is. Next, mood check in. The mood check in helps me express and release good and bad feelings and thoughts. Enjoy the good ones and let go of the bad ones. It even gives you a chance to write a little about them. It’s like your own personal diary, but way better. Last but definitely not least, I Believe this app can make you a better person. To be happier, to live life longer. It can be a real life changer. And just know that it’s never to late to start fresh again.  It’s never to late to change yourself. But most of all, it’s never to late lo be the big change in the world, that you have wished for. And calm can help with all of that. This is a total recommendation for anyone."
4,2020-05-24 19:52:55,4,"Honestly, I had come to a point in my life where I insomnia and anxiety were at an all time high , I was on anxiety meds, sleep meds, anything they could do to try & get my anxiety and insomnia under control & even when the pills weren’t really helping, I decided to try this app out because even doctors had recommend it, while yes- price tag can seem like a lot, BUT I used this one night while my anxiety was setting in and I was asleep half way through the sleep story and when I woke in the morning I was in disbelief. Nothing, I mean nothing had helped me until I found this app. The meditation & sleep stories are amazing. I am so grateful for this app. Now, the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars would be due to a recommend I have for the creators, they should create a watch or something that can track your sleep & in the morning provide meditations, music, sleep stories that reflected how you slept the night before. For example, if someone woke up a lot, or of people were waking up frequently and having a hard time going back to sleep &  maybe making suggestions for  a meditation they could choose that one as more personal, or for anxiety with sleep or sleeplessness, things like that. I don’t know that would be my only recommendation, but overall and amazing app that’s worth the price."
5,2020-12-03 06:15:22,4,"I love this app and use it all the time. Loads of new content added constantly. The length of the meditations is perfect. I love the series like 7 days of calm, 7 days of sleep, etc. the breathing exercises are so helpful. 

One area for improvement would be that currently most of the meditations, especially new content, is narrated by the same woman. It would be really helpful if these same sessions were recorded with a male voice, so listeners could have an option.  It would also be helpful if there were a more diverse selection of voices throughout the meditations. (This is done in the master classes and sleep stories, but I’d like to see it in the meditations too). A second area would be a review of the content of the gratitude meditations, which make assumptions and are therefore injurious for some listeners. For example I am in the middle of fighting a long term disease. Suggestions like you should be grateful for your health are not helpful and actually harmful for me. I’d really like to cultivate more gratitude but I can’t get through any of these meditations without being triggered. A review by someone working with diverse populations could help this. 

Other than this, I love the app. It has been designed so well and my mental health has improved dramatically since starting to use it. Highly recommended!"
6,2019-05-26 14:29:38,5,"This app has had an incredible impact on my mental health and overall quality of life. It has changed my perspectives and state-of-mind in ways that have been beneficial to every aspect of my everyday life and well-being, in a countless number of ways. By committing to the habit and genuine effort to a mere 10 minutes of meditation a day, I have observed a significant change to the way my brain works and handles day-to-day tasks and situations. I have gained peace-of-mind, appreciation, more quality and meaningful time spent with my family, the ability to approach things in ways that are more practical and productive and less stressful.... And this is just to name a few ways meditation has been useful and life-changing. My 10yo son insists on using it before bed every night in order to help him unwind and get a better night’s sleep. I use it for tension relief and to soothe migraines, or to calm myself down when I’m angry or upset. The mind is so powerful and can truly enhance one’s quality of life and well-being in ways you could never imagine possible. By obtaining a better mindset and maintaining the ways in which your brain works and thinks, you can come to realize what sort of impact it can make on your overall health, happiness and life."
7,2021-02-16 07:41:23,5,"Honestly a great app! Don’t listen to the negative reviews. They’re not necessarily complaining about the app itself. Some people complain about having to pay? Ridiculous. You probably pay for other apps that are most likely creating bad habits in your life, but you won’t pay for an app that’s actually great for your overall health? You have to pay for everything in this world.  Anyways, There’s tons of meditations you can choose from. lots of masterclasses to help deepen your awareness of mediation and even a bit of yoga too. There’s sleep stories to help you drift off to sleep after busy day. Honestly I tried other meditation apps in the past and this app exceeds every expectation I’ve had. Also did I mention you can drift off to the sound of Harry styles beautiful voice every night? ;) lol if there is one little teensy nuance that I hope there planning on changing, is “how are you feeling” tab. I wish they would add more/different moods. Sometimes I will feel overwhelmed, or scared, or depressed. the moods you choose from are kind of limited but it’s not so much a problem that it ruins the whole app. Overall Calm is one of my most used apps on my phone. if I could give this app 10 stars I would :) give it a try, you won’t be sorry."
8,2020-01-27 00:56:42,5,"I am a high school teacher at a high preforming high school in my area.  My students are often so stressed out and sleep deprived I feel so helpless to help them.  This year I decided to dedicate one day a week to meditating before we started class.  We do this every Thursday for the first 10-15 minutes of class. The response has been so positive from my students I am thinking of doing it two days a week next year.  The students LOVE Thursday!!  They have told me it’s the favorite part for their week.  Some students have even gotten the app for themselves.  I have heard so many times this year, “I needed that!” or “I needed to hear that today.”  After on session one of my boys said, “Man I was so upset about losing those 5 points on my English test and now I have let it go.  This really works.  What did you all think about?”  You know you are doing something right when teenagers open up and start talking.  Thank you for this product and allowing me the opportunity to give my students at least 15 minutes a week to destress, calm down, learn to love themselves and just breath! Can’t wait to see what the future has in store for me and my students as we take this CALM journey."
9,2020-06-24 04:02:44,3,"Dear calm, 

I have had your app since my middle school years. I’ve got to say, your app was AMAZING with 15 sleep stories and 2 and 1/2 meditations, this wasn’t a problem for me because I also use headspace. Yes, they're your competition but I wasn't choosing sides. Anyways, over time you guys added feature that you really focused on for 2 weeks at a time and just gave up on it. Next, you decreased the amount of sleep stories which was ha a huge problem for me because I was NOT getting enough sleep to keep my grades up. It got so bad that I stole my mother's phone just to sleep (she Had the Premium subscription). So I was like, ”ok, I'll just use headspace ONLY for sleep and calm for meditation. Then, you took away the 7 days of calm AKA: YOUR MAIN TRIAL AND ONLY TRIAL MEDITATION LEFT after you premiumfied the 7 days of something (forgot). I mean like BRU, I have other options. I started using headspace which is a great alternative if you don't have much money. I recommend bringing back some stuff from premium and reduce the price. To counteract this, put one 15 second ad at the beginning. Of every session of meditation for people without premium. Therefore, there is more than one reason to get it and it's CHEAPER. That's a win-win situation. I hope you come to the right decision. Whatever it is, I probably wouldn't stop using the app. Thank you for your time."
10,2020-10-08 14:01:42,5,"I really am indebted to Calm for working in my life during this pandemic helping me w my emotions, sleep help and maybe keeping me at a level arresting the memory decline that seemed to be coming on w it’s debilitating force. (I don’t use words like fighting it because most things should not be put into adversarial roles)
     I wish I had more from our guide Jeff on how to meditate. I really relate to his presentation because he seems quintessentially California to me.  I’ve been meditating since I was 6 or so, brought up Vedantist Hindu, born Jewish and am now a ChristianI am an aging hippie. I meditate w my cat on my lap, I simply press my hands on her sides and she grounds me and then is the anchor; her occasionally purring.  
     I love the pictures and the nature scenes. By the way I have been meditating every single day since November.  If I might be of assistance, I’m not sure how maybe I could do a Spark or something. I wish there were Something way to dialog - I have been on the site.  Maybe I could look more deeply into community of Calm. Thanks for saving my life as a process. This is one place I like to be every single day (sometimes night)
     contact me if you are interested in my story of success."
11,2019-11-20 04:05:50,4,"This App is my absolutely favorite to use when I’m going to sleep. I got it solely for the sleep stories and I’m absolutely obsessed. It’s like being a kid again and getting a beautiful story read to you by a soothing voice. While I use the app mainly for sleep stories I’ve used the meditation, background music, and breathing exercise options on the app as well. I used to use Headspace for a lot of my meditation sessions but with Calm having so many additional features I switched over fairly quickly. 

The only problem I have with this app is that I can’t set up a playlist/cue of the stories I want to fall asleep to. Sometimes I can’t fall asleep right away so I have to go through the process of unlocking my phone, setting up another story, and trying to settle down once again just to set up another story to be read. It quickly becomes irritating, especially on nights when I can’t fall asleep easily and have to go through the process of setting up an additional three stories and eventually giving up in the end. 

So if that can somehow be added then it’ll get my full 5 stars. But having nights where I’m on and off my phone throughout the night definitely makes me feel frustrated enough to keep it at 4 stars."
12,2020-01-31 13:10:47,5,"I recommend this app to anyone looking for a meditation app. I have even given gift subscriptions to friends looking to mediate because they are so in tune with their clients needs. They are always looking at feedback, offering content to meet needs and finding things to offer I didn’t even know I wanted. The narrators are wonderful & plentiful so if one doesn’t cut it for you, you can change. There is also calming sounds, perfect sleep stories and A daily check in to see how you feel and offer suggestions on what might help. Their Master classes are great for learning things like mindful eating, better sleep, how to relax, and even improving your performance in life. All star narrators like Lebron James, Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu, Bindi Irwin, Bob Ross, Jerome Flynn, Leona Lewis, Jason Kidd & more read sleep stories & give advice on how to improve aspects of your life. Sabrina Carpenter & Sam Smith give music mixes to help you sleep or relax. They even have a calm body to help you wake up, warm up/cool down from your workout, reset for the afternoon and wind down for the evening. This app is for your whole body not just your mind. Keep up the amazing work Calm. This app is worth every penny."
13,2021-02-06 05:53:07,5,"I’ve always struggled with anxiety and not being able to calm down. All of the features which this app has to offer really help me when I’m studying (I like having soundscapes or music on), relaxing (breathing exercises or meditation), and getting ready for bed (sleep stories and body scans). It is so worth it to pay for the subscription, and even before I paid for the subscription (my doctor recommended the app to me not knowing I had the free version of it for about 3 years already) there was a lot of content available. I love the calendar features as well, and the check-ins are a great way for me to reflect on my day and practice gratitude. 

One suggestion I have though are podcasts! I like to listen to people talking about any subject while I’m doing tasks around the house or just trying to sleep (sometimes the silence is a lot and I can’t focus on sleeping with my thoughts). If you guys made some soft spoken or any kind of podcast in which there wasn’t a lot of yelling and loud talking, I’d totally listen in. (I know there are some masterclasses and lesson type things available on the app already, but they’re just not podcasts)"
14,2019-01-31 19:34:21,3,"I recently re-downloaded this app and like the free features (when I downloaded it years ago one of my favorite features was “Scenes,” so as long as I have access to those for free, this app will stay on my phone). However, it’s a bit annoying that I now have a “Daily Calm Perception” notification on my screen that is locked and that I can’t remove. I don’t purchase app subscriptions, though I would be more than willing to support this app by individually buying content I was interested in as one-time purchases). If you don’t plan on allowing users to buy content separately, can you please at least give us the option to only view non-subscription content if we wish (with no content we can’t access clogging up the screen)? I read another review stating that some of the music was available to non-subscribers. It all appears locked for me. Can you clarify please? Also, are all 7 days for any of the meditations unlocked for free users? I just listened to the first day of “7 Days of Calming Anxiety” but I don’t think I can listen to the second one (or even repeat day one w/o subscribing, which is a bit ridiculous IMO). Please consider alternative payment models in the future. I’d love to support the app, just not with a subscription."
15,2019-01-20 22:13:19,5,"I am a lifelong insomniac. I spend most nights staring at the ceiling for an hour or more before I fall asleep if I do at all. This app has helped so much in getting myself into ""sleep mode"" and calming down & stopping my brain from rewinding the day or cycling through the next day's schedule. I occasionally listen to music but I mostly stick to the readings. My only request is to get Matthew McConaughey to do more readings! I have tried listening to others and they just don't work. I'd say my biggest complaint is they are all reading as though they are reading to an audience that's awake and aware. They are either too loud (even on the lowest setting) or reading with too much inflection which excites one rather than lulling one to sleep. MM knew his audience and his reading is in a very soft tone, his voice is calming and relaxing and he also seems to lower his voice as the story goes on, barely above a whisper by the end. All in all his is the perfect presentation and the only one I can fall asleep to! So please keep this story in rotation and if you can convince him to do more, please do! Otherwise I am content listening to the same story night after night."
16,2019-10-22 04:40:46,4,"I have had this app for more than a year and have very much enjoyed listening to many stories, perfect for lulling you off to sleep. I enjoy/prefer non-fiction stories and have heard all offerings multiple times. I find the whispered stories super creepy… But maybe thats just me. I haven’t listened to any music selections.
For the high subscription price though, the app should be nearly perfect, when in fact there are features missing. First, I wish that they would allow you to remove the stories that you don’t care for from the “playlist” so you wouldn’t have to sift through them each time you look for something you want to listen to. Additionally they are EXTRAORDINARILY SLOW to add new stories so consequently I have listened to the same “favorite” stories many many many times. I wish also that there were an option to list stories by “newest” so if they do add a new one it will readily be evident. The “nap” stories should not be listed with the “sleep” stories, since those have a “wake up” feature at the end.
With a few minor tweaks to allow a user personalize their preferences and more frequent content updates, this app could be exceptional."
17,2020-06-09 12:12:18,5,"This morning I woke at 4am in an unfamiliar state of presence and ‘calm’.  I drank water, started reading The Power Of Now (Eckhart Tolle), and after the introduction simply knew in that presence that I wanted to say hello to me, to consciousness, to the now.  I put down the book and played Day 2 - How to Meditate on this app I had just downloaded yesterday.   I am now finding my Homebase, through the calming inspiration narrated by Jeff Warren, and when I opened my eyes I was filled with such peace in this moment (now 5am) that tears welled up.  I embraced this expression of my self and felt pure joy.  This moment demanded a review of this app that I am grateful to invest in after my 7 day trial.  Everything else I enjoy about the logistics, user-friendly UI, and clean beauty of the app itself are all cherries on top of what I gained internally after only two days of meditating...breathing...feeling.  Thank you, developers.  I am humbly grateful for your inspirations.

On that note, my one request would be to incorporate the ability to Bluetooth or google cast the sessions and what not.  I’d love to play it through my tv when resting in bed or Bluetooth speaker when sitting by the pool!  🥰"
18,2020-05-02 18:52:09,5,"I found this app because someone I know recommend I try it for the sleep stories. I’m
a very busy person and my mind tends to race and sometimes I just can’t turn it off when I’m trying to sleep or relax. I tried one of the free sleep stories and I sacked out pretty quickly. I also tried the free background soundtracks and music when I was trying to concentrate. All worth the price of free admission. But then I tried the mediation. I’d always thought of meditation as new age mumbo jumbo. But many of the smartest people I know all have stories about when they started doing it and how it changed their life. So on a uncharacteristically unbusy Saturday I decided to try the meditation course. And now I realize how simple and profound it all is. It’s essentially just having then skill to not let your thoughts control how you feel. Not letting your emotions get the best of you. Once you can control your impulses, you are a different person. It’s really life changing. This course starts slow and you can see real benefits after a week or so. I know have my own story about when I started meditation and when my life changed for the better."
19,2020-11-10 02:40:18,2,"I downloaded this app when Apple recommended it. I have tried several guided meditation apps and am always open to the possibility of finding another one to add to my options for meditating alone. I could not open the app the first time without agreeing to be charged a subscription at the end of a one-week free trial. The app then asked me a few questions to try to determine what to recommend — how familiar I am with meditation, how often I meditate, and what I’d like to focus on in guided meditation. It then recommended I try a one-week course on stress. I figured I would give it a try, but I did not make it 60 seconds into the very first lesson before the person leading the meditation falsely claimed that a variety of physical chronic illnesses are *caused by* stress, the same utter garbage that some people claimed to me way back when I was diagnosed over 20 years ago. I immediately stopped the course but decided to try something else before giving up on the app. I tried a few of the daily meditations, but like another recent reviewer, I found the style of the person who always leads them doesn’t really mesh with my style. Then I had an anxiety attack and only later realized that I had forgotten this app was on my phone when doing things to calm myself. At that point I finally deleted it."
20,2019-10-17 07:21:08,5,"Over the last 5 months, I’ve been on a journey of personal growth. There was a lot that I was complacent about in life and I was tired of it. At the beginning, I had heard from my brother about meditation and all the benefits of it. I was half-invested, not sure if I believed all the claims (I hadn’t read any studies). So, I tried it a couple of times, but hadn’t had that meditation where it clicked yet. After a couple months though, I did some more research and started to meditate more regularly. 

While I am finally feeling more comfortable meditating alone, Calm helped guide me the entire way. There have been so many days where the messages and techniques from Calm have been extremely impactful on my life. The creators of this app did an absolutely fantastic job. And that’s not to say that the ultimate goal is to only meditate by myself. After a couple of days of mediating on my own, I love to come back to a guided session of the 21 days of calm and hear a message/lesson again. 

All in all, I highly recommend using Calm if you want to learn great techniques of meditation and also be inspired to improve and grow as a person."
21,2019-10-23 11:39:13,5,"I LOVE this ap. I had a near death experience (NDE) a little over a year ago. The emotional path that can follow was a little tough, as was seeing and feeling the imperfectness of being a human more intensely. Thanks to a few friends who had raved about meditation apps at a family reunion (not mine), I search and found this ap a few weeks after the NDE.  I love the effective, short Daily Calm meditation (~10-12 minutes), so easy to fit in, so effective in creating a calming break for the mind which can bring at least a moment’s peace, and can also help bring a much longer peaceful perspective reset. There’s even a three minute emergency meditation, nighttime sleep meditations, specific areas of interest series as well as wonderful option of Master Classes. Check it out. My longest streak (it tracks this for you) was 27 day, just after the NDE, but some were just a day or two before I miss a day or two. 
Focusing on the breath ... your breath ... following it. So effective. And the reflections at the end, with the beautiful daily picture ... are daily gems. Thanks to Tamara Levitt, thanks to Daily Calm."
22,2020-04-13 19:32:49,4,"This app was created to help people who are struggling with anxiety, daily stress, sleeping problems, or even depression. The app has many different resources and techniques given to help people. It has breathing exercises which can help people who are dealing with anxiety or stress. These breathing techniques are proven effective by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. The app has calming music to listen to while doing work or to help fall asleep. For someone who is struggling with depression the app gives many tips with the focus on mental health. These tips are how to maintain a strong mental health.  I downloaded this app since I saw a lot of advertising for it. My first impressions of the app were just okay. Once I figured out how to navigate around the app and use all of the features I began to enjoy it more and more. One of my favorite features about the app is the stories to help you fall asleep. One of the parts of the app that I did not like very much is that you have to pay to get a majority of the features. Although they do have a free 7 day subscription, I feel that you need to use it longer to get a good effect from the app. Overall I think that app is pretty cool and interesting."
23,2020-05-06 04:31:33,5,"I don’t know how I would be making it through the Covid 19 stress without this app. As someone who struggles with anxiety even in the best of times, I decided to try this app out to deal with the stress of the pandemic. I am so glad I decided to pay for full access to all of the features! I am learning how to meditate in ways that will benefit me for the rest of my life. I have recommended this app to all of my friends. The targeted sessions for different aspects of life (stress, sleep, anxiety, etc) are so helpful. There are meditations that are very short for when I need to be centered quickly to deal with a difficult situation and meditations that are longer for when I have time to do a more intensive session. A nice bonus is the relaxing music that I play while I’m working to keep a peaceful vibe throughout my work day. Unlike some meditation instructions, this app does not push any agenda that is targeted toward or against any particular faith, which I know has turned some people away from meditation apps in the past. I am so grateful for what this app has brought to my mind and spirit!"
24,2019-10-06 16:27:50,5,"I picked up Daily Calm after I realized my insurance had such a high mental health deductible that it would effectively never cover weekly therapy sessions. So I looked for other ways to get through a really stressful series of major life events including the death of a family member. I thought I’d try meditation. I’ve been using this app to guide short mediation sessions about an average of four times a week for over a year and it’s genuinely helped me. I can honestly say I’ve gained a life skill that I use every day even when the app is closed - closing my eyes and focusing on the breath for a few seconds even while I’m on the train or in a waiting room or about to go to an intense meeting at the office. This app isn’t the only way to gain that skill by any means, but it’s the one I picked up and it’s been pretty great. If you’re going through a hard time, the other things that have helped me the most with the depression and anxiety are gardening, hiking, in-person tabletop gaming, and cannabis microdosing. Crazy sounding combo, I realize, but I’m in *such* a better place than I was a year ago. Thanks for helping, Daily Calm."
25,2020-01-05 10:12:54,5,"I’ve been using Calm for about two years now; It is hard to believe I’ve logged several hundred meditation sessions. My mind still wonders. A lot. AND: I’ve strengthened several key muscles: concentration, clarity, equanimity, friendliness (which I learned about from Jeff Warren’s incredible 30-day meditation course included in the app).  I’ve recommended this app more than any other (I’ve tried, enjoyed, and positively reviewed several of the popular meditation apps), and I’ve heard from even occasional meditators that it has improved their skill and outlook. Another thing Jeff taught me: you don’t measure how effective/useful meditation is based on how many times your mind wanders when you sit, you look at how often and how smoothly  you  find yourself applying the concepts and activating the muscles you gain from sitting. The number of times I smile and notice something in a typical day is in the dozens. This app has definitely enriched my daily experience. It is worth trying, it is worth paying for, it is worth prioritizing in your life. (May you be happy; may you be strong; may you feel like you belong.)"
26,2018-11-06 16:03:27,5,"Ever since I tried the free version of Daily Calm I knew it was exactly what I needed. I have used the premium subscription for a year now and Calm has more than met my expectations but exceeded them by far. Every morning I am in guided meditation with Tamara and then I do the gentle morning wake up stretches which have made a huge difference in the pain I used to have from my back issues. I do the chair stretches at work and the back care exercises when my lower back is hurting. I also listen to the sleep stories every night and fall asleep before half the story is over. These stories are so soothing and relaxing. And there are so many different stories and meditations to choose from. I can’t wait to delve into the talks given by experts regarding mindfulness and breaking bad habits, etc. I just wish I had more time to spend on Calm because I enjoy it so much. It has been worth every penny and i just renewed my subscription. Daily Calm is exactly what I need on a daily and nightly basis. I absolutely love it and look forward to another year with these wonderful people in this amazing app."
27,2020-12-31 20:23:03,5,"I’ve really enjoyed this app for the Rain On Leaves soundtrack and Sleep stories, these really work! When I finally tried the premium version I was mostly looking forward to being able to explore all the recordings in Meditation, which are focused on interesting and helpful topics like relationships, anxiety, confidence, etc. Unfortunately, a lot of these are narrated by Calm’s Tamara Levitt, and if I can be honest, I find myself switching her off a lot and trying a different topic simply because her voice was unpleasant to listen to.  So it’s a bummer that I’m missing out on all the content recorded by her, but I am still getting a lot of use out of the app anyway. Narrating is a talent, and although not everyone is a natural at it or blessed with a soothing voice, it can be improved on with proper training, and talented narrators work on their ability to even out/lower their pitch, and avoid raspy breaking in their tone as these are the most bothersome sounds to human ears. Def important if you’re wanting to lead someone in a meditation or narrate and they are paying such close attention to the sound of your voice."
28,2020-10-25 19:52:53,5,"Forget melatonin and L-theanine pills. This app is all you’ll need to truly unwind, relax and fall peacefully asleep in no time. There is a variety of stories and meditations for pretty much every taste and style to put even the most persistent of insomniacs to sleep. With soothing, calming voices like Tamara Levitt’s and Eric Braa’s you are all but guaranteed to completely let go of your stressful thoughts, relax, and fall asleep in no time! While this app is great as is, I do have some suggestions that could improve it even further and bring it to the next, absolute highest level: 0) allow for bookmarking, or better yet, make the app remember where you left off in a particular story if you try a different story half way through, but then decide to go back or if you close the app and want to go back to that story you started 1) allow the user to preset the ‘stop time’ on longer meditations/stories. 2) allow sorting of all content by length of time 3) allow stitching of different clips (i.e. so users can piece together their own content from existing clips). Thank you and keep up the great work!"
29,2021-01-20 03:30:19,5,"During this time of isolation due to the pandemic, my daughter suggested I download this app. She’s been using it for a while and has premium. I downloaded it and I’m using the free service for now. This usually is not my “cup of tea“ and thought I would just try it. I have had a lot of anxiety and feel isolated and alone. I signed up and they have a very nice welcome letter. I tried one of the meditations and it is current with the times, it’s very relatable and because of that it has helped a lot. When I received the second long letter which I’m sure is a form letter but very well done, it has made me feel as if I am part of a community and a family which I do not have. Thank you from the bottom my heart for this wonderful app. There are plenty of meditations to choose from when you are first starting out and don’t understand the reviews about not having free meditations. This is a great stepping stone for someone who is new to meditation and I for one am very grateful. Great app. The meditations really are working for me and I recommend this to anyone who needs a little calm in their life."
30,2020-07-15 17:35:17,5,"It almost seems like everyone in the world has anxiety and depression nowadays. I dont want another problem like addiction to drugs so I was endlessly in search of alternative help. I just want to be more in control of my emotions. Hormones play a big part in my emotions. An instance that makes me furious, sad, depressed, hopeless, and aggravated one day could be the same instance on another day and it wouldn’t bother me a bit. Due to my fluctuations in emotions due to hormone changes I didn’t want to take pill(s) daily. So I stumbled across this app and gave it a try. NEVER LOOKED BACK. It’s wonderful for stopping me in my tracks and calming me down. But you do it often and the lessons follow in your life. I love love love the coach’s voice. I am a private person and don’t share my feelings which is helpful to some, but I don’t need to when I practice with the help of this app. You can choose how much time you want to spend. A lot or a little. There’s even an “emergency calm” selection, I haven’t used but am saving it for when I need that best friend to say “everything is going to be ok!”"
31,2020-08-06 16:00:55,2,"After having calm for several months now, I’ve enjoyed exploring to the variety of content from masterclasses to music to meditation. I also like the approach calm takes in encouraging you to develop your own daily practice of mindfulness. However, the main reason why I purchased calm was for the large library of meditations. However the bulk of new meditations come from the daily meditation which is always guided by the same person, Tamara Levitt. She also guides many of the meditation series they have available. Unfortunately I don’t enjoy how Tamara does her meditations and I find them more distracting than helpful. Because of this I find myself avoiding her meditations and whenever there is a choice for another voice I’ll pick it, but there are only so many of these. And, if you’re not doing the daily meditations, it doesn’t take too long before you feel like you’re running out of content. Calm is great if you enjoy Tamara’s meditations, but your kind of out of a deal if you don’t. I just think its unfortunate that there isn’t more variety in the voices available and authors coming out with new content. My wish would be for calm to at least have a second choice for the voice of the daily calm."
32,2018-11-25 08:17:57,3,"This app has really changed how well I sleep.  And for that I am truly grateful to the developers.  They definitely deserve all the accolades the app has been receiving.  I do have one major criticism thought that I wish I could get them to pay attention to at this time.  They apps content is very limited in comparison to other similar apps.  The major area of limitation is the sleep stories section.  There are only a handful of sleep stories that can not even get you through a month of nights without having to listen to the same stories over and over again.  Many users I know are focusing in on the sleep stories section because they work.  However, all have the same complaint as I do; just not enough stories and having to listen to the same stories over and over again.  Hey for little kids, this particular flaw is fine. Heck, I have read the Fantastic Mr. Fox to my youngest literally over a 100 times to get him to sleep.  For us adults, the developers of calm need to realize we need more variety in our sleep stories.  If this app only had more, I would be elated to change my rating to 5 out of 5 stars without a days hesitation."
33,2019-03-07 15:11:27,5,"Do you experience any stress in your life? Or, perhaps your life is spinning out of control. Or, if not, you may find yourself somewhere in between. The Calm app does not solve life‘s problems but it does help reframe them to give us a better way of living with and living through our problems. One of the greatest features is the Daily Calm which is a 10+ minute meditation. This does not mean zoning out to some strange mantra and pursuing another mystical realm! Instead, the user is guided through various styles of mindfulness. At the conclusion, guidance is given on how to approach life or reframe our issues in order to better live life rather than life dominating you. If you do choose to subscribe, there are probably hundreds of targeted series (and growing)-/ everything from sleeping better to dealing with relationships with others, dealing with loss and even dealing with yourself. Using this app consistently (I use it frequently, not daily—I sometimes forget or get caught up in my business!) will surely help you not control your life but learn to not be controlled by your life."
34,2020-11-13 18:12:39,5,"I have chronic pain and just had surgery on my spine fusing my L5 and S1 vertebrae, I also have chronic insomnia. All of this plus PTSD is what caused me to search for an answer to bring my Mind, Body & Spirit back to me. In just One Week, I began to learn how to quiet my Mind enough to sleep all night now.  I’m no longer sleeping or in bed 10-14 hours.  I have started sleeping 8hours or less and wake earlier feeling rested. I’ve realized that I am waking up with less pain, both of these Benefits are just because I decided I’m worth, I deserve to be able to sleep and take care of Myself as a whole Person. 
If you are having even One Goal, I Highly Recommend Calm to you.  My life has begun to change in just One Week.  I’m looking forward to learning how to Meditate.  I had my 10min introduction this morning, and I am feeling Hopeful Today.
Get Calm, for your Mind,Body and Spirit.  Try it for 7 days and then decide if you are Better or The Same.  Just one place that is the Most Important Self Care, Restful Sleep.  After just One Week I’m Feeling better and have less morning pain."
35,2019-12-08 16:22:55,5,"I absolutely love this app. I’m a Christian and a senior in college. Previous meditation experiences have made me so uncomfortable because they ask me to recite something or meditate on something that goes against my religion. This app doesn’t do that! Also, I struggle with the epidemic in out world of Hurry Sickness (google it. It’s a thing.) I do too much, say yes to too much, worry myself, stress myself out, and don’t give myself quiet time. This app reminds me to care for my heart and brain. I meditate daily, every morning using the daily calm. I then do a timed meditation and spend time in prayer and meditating on my God. Starting my day like this makes me so prepared to deal with the hurry of life. I also do at least one other meditation throughout the day. I love the sleep meditations. I haven’t tried the stories yet, and I’ve been using this app for several months. I think I’ll focus too much on the voice and story to fall asleep. So! I just do a guided sleep meditation. I have no requests for how to fix this app. The price is reasonable and I’ve had no issues with the app.  10/10 recommended!!!"
36,2017-11-29 02:21:13,5,"I never knew much about meditation until a mentor introduced me to the practice. It is exactly that, a practice. I found it difficult at first to stay focused but found that it came more easily the more I did it. I became hooked and noticed the positive impact it had on all aspects of my busy, hectic life. I knew I wanted to continue guided meditation and my mentor recommend finding an app that I liked. After trying free-trials of several apps I knew hands down this was the one for me. The selection of background sounds, and her soothing voice were exactly what I was looking for. The length of sessions are sufficient to fully relax and recharge yet not too cumbersome to fit into a busy schedule. I come to look forward to the sessions at the end of each day as my “me time.”  I like that there are pre-programmed sessions aimed at specific topics or goals and there are daily sessions as well. The fact that the app keeps track of my progress helps to keep me motivated to never skip a day.   I can’t say enough good things about this app, well worth every penny!!  I am hooked."
37,2020-06-02 16:06:19,4,"Like many expensive subscription apps Calm claims to support Apple Family share.  However, In-app purchases and subscriptions cannot be shared, so no, your purchase of Calm cannot be shared.  Only the free portion (accessible for 1 week) can be shared—which is of course unnecessary since family members don’t need family share for something that is already free.  Family members would actually be better off downloading it directly because the free access only lasts one week so they’d at least get their own trial period instead of whatever remains of a family member’s.  There is fine print in the App Store which says that Family Share does not support in-app purchases and subscriptions, but nothing in the app itself will tell you that your $70 one year subscription cannot be shared with a family member or significant other.  It would be simpler and more honest if Calm would opt-out of Family Share so it would not display that capability on their App Store description as Family Share is only relevant and useful for one-time paid apps.  You have a very nice app otherwise."
38,2020-09-08 22:46:01,3,"I got a year of premium on this app and absolutely adore it. The depth, care, and detail that went into making this app the best of its kind are not at all lost on me. It’s been very helpful to me with managing sleep and anxiety, really to life-changing levels. But I find my biggest complaint and the thing that makes me go through bouts in which I stop using it altogether is the lack of variety in narrators. Tamara Levitt is used to narrate a very large number of exercises and while her voice is positive and upbeat—she really is lovely, I’m sure!—it’s not AT ALL relaxing and totally grinds on my nerves. I literally cannot listen to any audio that she does in this app and as I said, there are many. It’s really disappointing. I’ve found the male narrators, specifically Elisha Goldstein, have a slower cadence and a much more relaxing tone that allows me to decompress and stop my anxiety attacks or drift off to sleep. But repetitive listening of certain audios can lead me to memorize it, which I find has me anticipating the words rather than absorbing them. I would really appreciate more frequent updates to the “cast” in these audios, especially ones for sleep and anxiety management."
39,2019-02-09 13:03:24,4,"Okay, I will be honest this app is so relaxing. At first, I thought that it would be some kind of boring app that wouldn’t have any use— well I was wrong. This app is so good. There are different types of meditations that you can do for seven days, sleep stories that will make you fall asleep, classical music, relaxing backgrounds that you can change anytime, yoga lessons, and to just breath normally. I started about a week ago, and I have been so relaxed after that. I don’t get as mad when my lil sis hides in my room and steals things, I don’t get as frustrated when my parents ask me to do double chores with no extra allowance. But there is something that I will have to point out before you download this app— most of the things are NOT free! Most sleep stories are not free, most meditation thingies are not free (you can only have one sample then every other day is locked, ask of the relaxing music costs money, it is the same for the yoga. You need to buy a year’s worth of unlimited pro, month, or week. To me it is kind of unfair, but they still allow a few sleep stories and I can get relaxed even without the pro needed."
40,2017-11-21 13:43:10,5,"I am loving Calm. It is perfect for where I am right now. I love the 10 minute daily calm. I look forward to the new topic each day and 10 minutes is a very manageable amount of time even in my busy schedule. I am working through the 21 day beginning meditation series as well. I like that I can do the daily calm each day and then add a 10 minute beginning session when I have time. Tamara’s voice I find very pleasant and reassuring. I like being able to choose some soothing background sound like birds chirping or fire crackling. And finally I am enjoying the sleep stories and find they are helping me fall asleep more quickly in the evenings. The only negative is I’m not too fond of the music selections. I find most of the music to be somewhat jarring and irritating rather than soothing. I would love if some peaceful soothing music were added as options. So right now I just don’t listen to the music. Overall, this app has been fantastic for helping me learn to quiet my mind and stop destructive thought loops. I am definitely feeling calmer and more present than ever before."
41,2019-08-01 12:40:46,5,"My father died March 4, 2019, of vascular dementia and Parkinsonism. This app got me through a year of grief and anxiety - the likes of which I had never experienced- so deep was our hurt watching our father die so slowly and losing him bit-by-bit over time. His sickness was made more stressful because my parents live in another state and I was driving 12-hours every weekend to get to them. Plus, I was in grad school, working full-time and had (still do) very involved children in both high school and college. Beginning last summer, the grief and worry was becoming so great that I couldn’t breathe. My mind was racing so fast, I couldn’t sleep. Even using prescriptions to sleep and relax, I knew I needed more help so went online, really, sort of desperate. I found “Calm.” I didn’t miss many days meditating after that. The sleep stories replaced my prescription meds for sleep (eventually), and Calm was an anchor as the end for Dad got closer and when he died. As a college professor, I recommend it now to all my students. I see Calm as an essential part of my healthy life."
42,2019-12-12 15:49:34,5,"I was skeptical at first because of the prices for the subscription deal, but my dad did the math and it’s actually not as bad as it looks. Still a bit pricey, but not bad. My dad used to be a computer programmer, so he knows why people use the subscription payment model. I’m using the app right now and it has helped me so much! I have really bad anxiety and cope with distractions poorly.(I’m medically diagnosed with A.D.D. and Asperger’s syndrome.) I have a better understanding of why apps do things like this. I mean, if you were a developer and made something that helps people, wouldn’t you want to have something in return? I think most people would agree that they wouldn’t want to make a product and have people not pay for it. Gotta pay the rent somehow. I’m still not a fan of that kind of payment system, but I’m more informed about it thanks to my dads former experience of being a computer programmer. Like it says in the title, once you get past the subscription, the app does its job beautifully."
43,2020-12-29 17:51:12,5,"There’s only 1 subscription option and it’s for a $70.  Yes it’s for a year but we’re in a crisis right now, the bill to save people from being evicted hasn’t been signed yet still and people are still without adequate jobs especially gig workers. The current subscription offer takes advantage of this and is not the type of app I would want to use to relieve stress and anxiety as it is clearly only wants to relieve nearly empty bank accounts.  What... people are supposed to decide between making you richer or being responsible for their families and paying their rent and utilities.  Ppl are supposed to decide whether their emotional and mental health to ease the stress in their lives is more important than the actual issues going on.  Yes some people can pay $70, either they can afford it or they’re bad at money and should be using it elsewhere.  Come up with more sub options please, at least break down the $70 into manageable chunks.  You could probably even charge more that way, I’m sure that would make your pockets happy."
44,2019-03-18 10:39:31,4,"This app has been incredibly helpful for me; the focused texts are simple enough to be absorbable / not distracting in a state of meditation, when you need it most. The 7 days series is excellent. The texts themselves are poignant with the exception of some cultural references Ive heard (honestly, I don’t think this is any place to mention what Amanda Palmer from Dresden Dolls thinks) - trying way too hard with that.
My main issue which has kept me from being able to use about 50% of the guided meditations, including Daily Calm and most other practices, is that I just can not bear the speaking voice of Tamara Levitt. I’ve tried & tried and i just can’t. It it is probably just me but she really rubs me the wrong way in how mushy and drippy her voice is...it comes across as disingenuous but I realize that the intention is exactly the opposite. It would be really nice to have at least one other choice for each program - ideally the other one would be more neutral. It’s a pity because I like the content very much, but otherwise, with no adjustments of added narrators it will probably keep me from renewing my subscription."
45,2020-11-29 10:14:21,5,"My aunt got me three months for my birthday in late October . Ashamed I’ve waited nearly a whole month to use the gift card , but I am extremely impressed . I always has bias towards this app just due to its advertisements and monthly subscription cost . These days everything has a subscription and also costs money. I recommend you give it a month for a free trial and if u don’t like it then u don’t have to use it . I love all the music options for sleep and I haven’t checked out the stories or the mediation section just yet . I think this app has potential and is more then likely one of the best apps for mental health ( maybe I’m not sure ) Anyhow , it has a sleep timer and you have the ability to download music files to the app for offline use .... 
As a person that suffers from insomnia and an irregular sleep cycle , I hope this app can help me as I have issues holding down a job because of anxiety and other mental disease. 
My name is Morgan , I’m 22 years old , and I wanna thank u for reading my review ... If anyone ever does ... Stay frosty friends . <3"
46,2017-08-26 05:54:26,5,"My doctor had shared with me about the benefits of meditation.... I needed something to help when I was anxious as well something to help me relax. Shortly after that doctor visit I found the Calm app. It's been almost 2 years. It had been a stressful day and there was an introduction to the app and I took the 10 minutes and did the breathing and really focused on relaxing. I went back to work and I immediately told everyone about Calm.... I have been using it ever since! The time I meditate is my time to focus, to breathe and to just be in the moment. I had horrible insomnia and started the body scans... I tried the sessions without buying the subscription but soon found that I wanted more of the sessions after I did the first; so I bought the subscription and have never regretted it once! It's been a godsend. I love the bedtime stories and the daily Calm.... there is so much on this app that has helped me. I love that the app is adding new things. Thank you Tamara for sharing and helping me bring peace and calm into my life!"
47,2019-12-29 16:20:18,4,"I really like your sleep story’s everyone I started I’ve been at least getting to fall asleep faster but I know you can’t do much about this but I just can stand the guy who is in most of the story’s I want to read, his name is Alan sklar or something like that and some other boys I can’t remember the names of I just want to tell you so maybe you could make most of them girls because I think they have a more smooth voice witch in Science is proven to be better to listen to at night and it soothes people to listen to witch in most cases reacts to better sleep including me but in all I think you app is helping millions in ways you can’t imagine better sleep can help with better minds you could save lives if they have better minds they can think before they end there life sleep is extremely important all you need to do now Is get a good add that will intrigue people that need help and they won’t just turn the volume down on the adds they will listen. Please take this into consideration I’ve already lost someone to choice of death you could save people from that. Yes it might seem impossible Just TRY."
48,2020-03-21 03:26:27,5,"I have had anxiety for about 7 months and recently, has been growing.  I try to do as much as I can to calm myself down when I feel anxious.  I have seen ads about this app before, and wasn’t really convinced at the time.  However, I recently was shown an ad and thought to my self if I should get the app.  A few minutes later, it’s on my phone.  I really admire the people behind this game for creating an app for people like me, and it makes me feel hopeful that there are still people out there who care about others like this.  I also really like how even though they present you with calm premium, that they still have many options to choose from with out spending a single penny.  So, to conclude my review, I just want to say how I think this app will help me.  I am going to continually come back on the app for at least a month, and I can foresee me feeling better because of it.  I believe this app will help me a lot, and I would like to thank the creators again, for making this app."
49,2020-11-18 22:02:23,1,"This is a really great app and I absolutely love how it greets you and has a daily check in thing. But I wish everything didn’t need premium!!! I mean I get it. You have to make some money out of it...but everything being locked just adds more stress (which defeats the purpose of the app :/). I have deleted this app numerous times because of this reason and every time I redownload it more things are locked. And I was really upset when I saw the Winnie the Pooh thing was locked 🥺😔This is a great app....to the ppl with premium :| So therefore I came up with a few suggestions ^•^ My first suggestion is to have it to where you can watch an ad and that meditation session is unlocked or everything is unlocked for however many hours. Honestly I would rather have an ad after every other meditation than have all of them locked. Another suggestion I have is for if you didn’t like the first one; just have like maybe half of the meditations locked and a few of the free ones has like half of their sessions locked. Also I would really like it if some of the music was unlocked (being a musician myself I love listening to calming instrumental 🥰) Please consider my suggestions and thank you for taking time to read this, have a great day!! ^•^"
50,2020-01-03 04:08:55,5,"I love this app!  I was struggling with anxiety and restless nights as I am working full time and going to school full time and couldn’t seem to quiet my mind at bed time. The meditations, sleep stories, and ambient noise have all helped me tremendously.  I’m getting the best sleep since I can remember.  

I do have one suggestion, though.  As they are meant to do, the sleep stories often get me to sleep, but once the story ends, it is just silence.  The ambient noise helps me to stay asleep, but I can’t find a way to have the ambient noise begin once the sleep story or meditation session ends.  It would be great to be able to make a playlist of sorts where ambient noise automatically kicks in at the end of the sleep story or meditation session. That way, if I’m already asleep or very close to it, there is no need to go back into the app to turn on ambient noise, risking the light from my phone putting back to an awaken state.  

Thank you, Calm!  Everything else about this app is fantastic and has truly benefitted me and my mental health."
51,2020-01-01 03:44:36,2,"I love the app! But that’s a lot of money. I think there should be an app that thinks about the people using it more, because some people can’t afford this including me. I’m trying to look for a app that helps with my anxiety and this app is great but I don’t have the money to get what I need on this app. This seems like a little much to charge $70. This helps people’s stress, anxiety, depression, and more. There are a ton of options you can use which is great if you have $70. You should have more free things and give more price options. Like you could have a certain amount of money for a week or a month or even even a few months, not just charge to only get it for a  year. And you could lower the price for a year even if it’s just by a few $. This might attract more people to the app and you would make more money. You would probably get better ratings too. If you have the $ to spend on this app spend it! It’s not going to be a waste of your $. This has sleep stories for people of all ages including kids, it has all different kinds of sounds, it has meditation, and it has breathing exercises. GET THIS APP if you have the money to spend for it. It won’t let you down."
52,2020-12-04 14:10:55,4,"Everything about this app is excellent. I used to dread laying in bed, trying to calm my mind for sleep, but now with the calm app I look forward to my sleep story and soundscape every night. However for the way I use calm there is one major shortfall in the app. There is no way to line up a queue or playlist of recordings. I will make it to the end of a sleep story, be close to sleep but not quite there and then have to search through the app again to turn on my soundscape. I know this doesn’t sound like a big deal but for me who has always had trouble falling asleep it is very disruptive. It is also disruptive when I use the app to help my 10 yr old son fall asleep- I put on a sleep meditation for him, but he always wants a sleep story to follow. I either have to stay in his room through the whole meditation so I can start the sleep story, or he has to climb down from his bunk bed to do it, disrupting the calm we just established with the meditation. This app is so thoughtful in so many ways I am surprised and disappointed they have not found a solution for this yet."
53,2020-06-07 16:39:26,5,"I am a busy mom. I work full time. I travel. I have struggled with worry, rumination, perfectionism, some anxiety, and poor sleep, for years. Even more-so after becoming a mom, which comes with a whole new set of worries for another person! I have tried through the years to get myself into a routine that includes meditation & relaxation, but always fall off track. THIS app allows me to plug in any time I want, and seek a brief meditation on a topic that I am most in need of at that moment. Whether I’m stressing over a big presentation, or having trouble with connection, the list of guided meditations is plentiful. Or I can just go solo one day (unguided) to the tranquil sounds of the scene of my choice. I also now love doing this...I open the app, choose a scene, usually a nature scene (with audio), set preference for scene to function while app is closed,  connect it to my Bluetooth speaker, and let it play while the phone is displayed right in front of me on my desk working from home. Def try the premium trial. It’s worth it to go premium."
54,2017-09-01 02:33:01,5,"1st off, I TRULY appreciate the app giving me time to try its features before asking for an App Store review. I absolutely HATE when you've used an app for all of 5 minutes and then it asks you to rate it. Absolutely awful, how would I really know? This app gave me the time to explore it and use it for a good week before asking for a review. Bravo!

As far as the app itself, by session 7, I REALLY zoned out into the meditation and almost put myself to sleep I was so calm. I remember when I first began I was anxious to check when I would be done. But by the end of the week, I was surprised we were done already. I'm excited about that. 

The music is calming, the guidance is very calming and helpful. And it's very easy to use and I love the reminder and quotes at the end. Again, I can't rate this app highly enough. I hasn't even asked me to upgrade to the paid version yet so I don't know how much it costs to continue meditating but I sure hope I can afford it. They deserve being compensated for the labor of this app!"
55,2019-12-30 16:27:21,2,"Today I found myself in a EXTREMELY stressful situation and I needed to be calmed down. I decided to download this app because I couldn’t take it anymore. I read the reviews and a lot of people were complaining about the locked features. I thought it couldn’t be that bad. I was wrong. Almost everything helpful is locked. I found myself not only stressing out about the situation I’m going through but this app. Now I know it’s not a lot of money but even if it’s like a couple cents a month, I stress about it. I’m not poor or anything it’s just that I have a lot of anxiety. I mean a lot. This isn’t a very helpful app if almost everything helpful is locked. All the music is locked which would help me the most. Very disappointing but I gave it an extra star because if we had some helpful things, it would be an amazing app. I saw a response to a review like mine saying that they make it so expensive so they can keep building the app. Omg these people who made this aren’t very smart. Have you seen all the 5 stars? If you make it cheaper, there will be more people buying the app and then the reviews won’t be as bad and you’ll have even more money. $70 is just outrageous."
56,2020-05-29 13:44:38,5,"About two years ago, I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. You know how it goes. Even on meds now, I still have bad days. Well, for about a stretch of a month now, I’ve been having awful nightmares. I’ve always had trouble sleeping, but it was getting to the point where I had /maybe/ two hours of sleep a night. It wasn’t even good sleep; it was the kind where your body is asleep, but your mind is awake, so it leaves you feeling like you never slept in the first place. Then I remembered that my therapist had recommended this app for me. Now about a year ago, on my old phone, I had the app but never used it. Smart, right? Well, I downloaded it again, and when I went to bed, I put on one of the free stories. The next thing I knew, I was waking up, perfectly rested and actually tired from being asleep! This is the first I haven’t had a nightmare in a month! I think this app hit me with a melatonin nightstick😂
But in all seriousness, thank you so much. It’s been fantastic so far, and I’ll continue to use it."
57,2020-07-14 16:51:16,5,I love this is so calming it calmed me down because I was mad at my sister she was annoying me and so was my dog Sophie my dog Sophie was annoying me to so when I did the calming you down thing I was so calf I didn’t hurt my sister or my dog 🐕 so thank you for making this please make more things like this game and whoever made this I was am going to tell you you did a very very very very very very very good job i’m just telling you that I love love Love love Love this game. Please please please make more games like this.  I am just saying  I needed this app to  erase all my thoughts I was having  A lot of stuff going on in my head but that changed when I listened to the meditation it cleared all of the thoughts that were in my head so I just really really wanted you to  make more apps like this one. Just one thing you need to change well I don’t have  premium and you need to bring stuff back for the people without  premium like me all the other things I love love except the  premium thing that’s the only thing that I hate.
58,2019-12-18 19:35:45,5,"Having used this app for a couple years now, I have some experience that has changed me. I have learned that breathing well is as important as good blood flow in your veins. People don’t naturally think of it as important because our brains do it unconsciously and we don’t have to think about it. But when we stop to take a moment and breathe, we find that heart rate shifts, emotions are regulated, and perspectives change. It actually feels quite miraculous. 
As a Christian, I know that many people are leery of (even the word) meditation. However, it is my joy to carry the message of truth regarding meditation. Meditation (ie using my own breath) has carried me through hard times and bolstered my energy when I’m weary. It is using the body and breath to be the recharge, the Gatorade, if you will,  to the soul. Even Job 33:4 says, “the Spirit of God has made me, the breath of the Almighty gives me life. “  
Breath is profound and simple all at the same time. Our breath is a gift and I believe a life lived well, tends this gift."
59,2019-11-03 06:21:04,5,"This is a must have app if you have bad anxiety like me and other things but there’s just one little problem.... THE PREMIUM I got this app recently and I’m already loving but there’s ones that I think are really cool but it says start 7-day free trial and if I forget about having it then I sorta wasted my money for nothing. But I also had  a little suggestion, you could still have the trial and that stuff but I was thinking of like having a little thing were each time u do one you get like 5coins and you can use them to unlock more and maybe still have some free and but ya, like make it to we’re you can unlock more sessions and stuff by like saying yay you got 5 coins great job! Just to like be like good job you completed a session, just to like make them feel happy, so ya that’s what I have to say but other than that this is a must have app hope you guys take my advice and I hope this app will have and update about my advice thank you tho!"
60,2020-11-04 20:16:05,5,"This app is definitely very relaxing. I used the guided meditations to help manage anxiety. Th first thing I noticed upon downloading the app is that the home screen is soft in color and hue, and there are relaxing water noises playing. This already put me in a relaxing mood before beginning the exercise. I like that there are different meditations for different stressors (relationship problems, work, etc.) because it helps me choose one that’s best for me and helps me set intentions for the meditation. I like that the meditations do focus a lot of physical sensations such as muscle tension and breathing because I do deal with physical sensations caused by anxiety. In my abnormal psychology class, we learned about the importance of slowing down and breathing. The way breath work was incorporated into the meditation reminded me of a breathing exercise my professor taught us in class during which you hold your breath both on its way in and on its way out. Very effective in helping me take a step back from my stress and anxiety and i recommend this app!"
61,2020-06-16 13:04:37,5,"I’ve been under a lot of extra stress since this whole pandemic started. I suffer from anxiety, depression and PTSD and I take supplements to help with the symptoms and normally they work well but lately I’ve been having more anxiety attacks and I was doing some free meditation tools and they worked but they only had a couple of options. I had heard of calm but always thought I didn’t need it . I looked at the app and all it offered and was blown away so I decided to sign up for the free seven day trial . It’s only been one day into the trial and I’m definitely keeping it! It’s helping me stay calm and focused and they even have stuff for kids so both me and my daughter can benefit from it 👍🏻 . I highly recommend using this app! They have guided meditations, sleep stories, music, nature sounds, classes on various topics and even fitness options. It’s amazing what you get for the yearly subscription price. In my opinion, it’s worth it if you struggle with any type of mental illness or have even occasional stress."
62,2019-12-25 06:04:04,5,"I never, ever write reviews. But I am SO grateful for this service. I had awful insomnia for the longest time. I’ve been using the Calm app for a month and I recommend to anyone who will listen. It just takes 10-30 mins of sleep stories and I’m out for the whole night. It’s been such a blessing. I don’t use the meditations or ambient noise, it bugs my husband, but I just go to bed 30+ mins before him and by the time he comes up to bed I’ll be out cold.  I will happily recommend this app to any friends and family that struggle with falling asleep. I love the sleep stories. The price tag is well worth it and I use it almost every night.  I wish Matthew McConeghey would do more of them that were less distracting because his voice is soooo soothing but his sleep story is like distracting because of the content. I love the Jerome Flynn stories though, I listen to them frequently. I wish you would do more of the Alice in Wonderland series, it’s sooooo soothing. Thank you for such a great service!"
63,2019-10-31 16:20:04,5,"I was recently diagnosed with IBS. My GI recommended doing daily meditations to help relieve some of the stress and anxiety that can exacerbate my symptoms. I read some research articles on the topic and found one included in the American Journal of Gastroenterology which showed that meditation significantly improved symptoms in women with IBS. I decided to give meditation a try. As a busy medical student, I wasn’t sure if I would have the time to make meditation a daily practice. I have made time for meditation each day since my diagnosis 2 months ago and have found it to be very helpful, especially when I am having a flare-up. It really has allowed me to break that vicious cycle of symptomatic exacerbation worsened by anxiety about my symptoms flaring up. Obviously, other lifestyle modifications (e.g. diet, exercise, sleep, and even medication) might be necessary to control and/or alleviate symptoms. I have had to make other lifestyle modifications too. Thus far, meditation has been a very effective aid in my IBS management. I highly recommend the Calm app!"
64,2018-04-26 20:18:41,5,"Two days ago, I ran into a specialists office panicking over clogged ears. Stupid, right? That’s how anxious, panicky people are. We think we are dying all the time. Went to bed with clogged ears and anxious. I was hoping a good sleep would calm me down enough for the next day. Nope. Woke up more anxious than normal with those clogged ears. While driving to work, I had a sudden urge to go to the ER and beg for anything to calm me down. I am one of those people who does not want medication, but I was desperate. I saw Calm on a commercial last night and didn’t think it would benefit because I was in bad shape. I tried the free version and it was ok, but i wanted more and I’m glad I did. I did the first day of 7 days of calm today and it helped me immensely. I no longer felt like jumping out of my skin and i got some relief. Every now and then, I feel a little anxious but I can now calm myself down and get back to work. And this is just day one. For those who are suffering greatly, keep and open mind and try this."
65,2021-01-20 20:52:18,5,"I am very reluctant to use this type of apps. However, this one always called my attention and during my last insomnia crisis I decided to explore. Oh my God, this app is not just a help to sleep better but to Live better! It has been about 10 days since I started and I am in love with it. I am 58 y.o. Venezuelan Female, Medical Doctor, married to a Wonderful Woman - my Soul Mate- living in a foreign country. She is deep into meditation and I feel so behind but I met Jeff and he has  introduced me to meditation in such an easy and accessible way. I have attempted for many many year with others but I always fell asleep. Besides and like now, I am at work and have some boring stuff to do. I just have to look for some new music on the app to switch my mood and be able to “keep walking”. So, Thanks Jeff! and thanks the lady with the sweet voice- can’t remember her name!- and thanks to all the talented people that make possible this unbelievable tool. My year subscription is really worthy to be paid!"
66,2020-11-13 14:52:48,1,"Why do you have to charge $70? I loved it two years ago when it was cheaper. I got sick and had to let it lapse and now I go back to get back to the app to find it’s now so expensive. You won’t even look at my comment because you’ll see all the other comments and skip mine because it’s solely about money in an already greedy world. You don’t even offer a monthly plan. Otherwise, I would have given a five star!!! But the cost turns my stomach on principle! There are many people with high anxiety and insomnia that this app might reach and help, and you’d be doing such a great thing for those people if this wasn’t so expensive all upfront! I thought that was what Calm was all about....helping! I’ll look for another 5 star app! I will be deleting this app. You even took away the content I downloaded from when I had paid!!! I know you have to make money, but $70 and no way to do a monthly plan means you’re going to loose people. But with all the 4’s and 5’s, you won’t care about and comments that have to do with pricing as I’ve seen your stock answer to the other complaints about the same issue!! So people who can’t afford don’t count to you! Until they do, you’ve lost my business!!"
67,2020-08-03 04:00:02,1,"I have insomnia, and a friend suggested I try Calm. I figured no harm no foul, worst case scenario it doesn’t help at all. So I’m all excited to maybe get more than the usual hour or two of sleep, I download the app. And boom, I’m supposed to pay $70 for a subscription just to sleep better. As someone who struggles with a sleep disorder, this just seems like being taken advantage of so someone can sit back and make their money. Also, with COVID-19 going on and so many people such as myself out of work, the least you could do is offer a promo, or something more enticing than 7 free days. A week is literally nothing when you have to pay a YEARLY, not monthly, subscription, especially for the price. I just don’t understand how someone’s well-being and mental health can have a price tag, much less how anyone could exploit that for their own gain. Extremely disappointed, but also not trying to change anyone’s mind. Try it for yourself, and if you have the money to spend, it appears that the app works judging off of other comments I’ve read. I just think the app could be even more accessible with either a lower subscription price, or the ability to listen to some of the stories without having to buy premium."
68,2019-07-28 21:03:55,5,"I stumbled blindly into using this app. First was to help me sleep with the sleep stories and now for the past 7 months using the meditation section, it has changed my life entirely! I’ve literally been reborn. It was a painful transformation as I let go to all that held me back. All that I was before has grown so much. My perspective has shifted and I’m no longer so frustrated when things don’t go as expected. I am now just breezing through life and things just seem to fall into place when I least expect it. Not fighting the flow of life anymore thanks to this app. I have a committed daily practice now and I don’t ever see it going away. Now if I could ask for one thing it would be a section added for fertility. None of the other fertility meditations are seem as good as these are. I can only imagine how well this app could do them and the woman who could use the support and guidance through trying to conceive to birthing a child. Please please add it to the app. 💗"
69,2020-12-30 06:19:23,4,"I’ve used this app on and off for a while as a free user and then finally just signed up for the subscription. It’s truly money well spent. Mindfulness and meditation have science backing how beneficial they are for our minds, and Calm does a fantastic job guiding you through that journey. We spend money on frivolous things all the time, why not invest in your mental well being? Especially with how bad this year in particular has been. It takes a little time, a little practice, and a little patience but you will be able to do it! The only complaint I have is not being able to cast to my google home. My boyfriend both want to fall asleep to the sounds and sleep stories but it’s not nearly loud enough in the phone for it to even be heard. That’s the only reason for the 4 stars, because I think that is a needed feature. It would be nice to cast my meditations on there too. Besides that, the app is wonderful. User friendly, super helpful, great content, and it actually doesn’t help once you get the hang of it. I recommend Calm to everyone!"
70,2020-10-24 13:31:53,5,"I have been using Daily Calm for over a year. I don’t always meditate everyday, other days I meditate several times a day. 

Daily Calm has taken the “ugh” out of meditation for me. It helps me slow my mind down. It helps me sleep and/or get back to sleep. It helps me with anxiety when it comes up. It guides me through certain difficult situations. I love the tools that are added. I’m a huge fan of the Spark conversations.  I like the daily check in feature - it helps me get grounded on my current state of mind. I love the gratitude checklist. The new daily reflection feature allows me to put the mindfulness to work in my relationships with myself and others. The various meditation series are also really helpful. There are series on gratitude, emotional resilience, mindful eating .... there are so many!

I also love that Daily Calm refers to meditation as a practice and allows me to use it at my pace and comfort level.   Meditation is a practice and it’s helping me navigate the ups and downs of daily life."
71,2017-08-27 13:58:25,5,"I struggle with anxiety and insomnia. I've meditated on and off for years and felt better but recently had lost interest in my usual mantra meditations. I'd been thinking mindfulness would be good to try but couldn't quite get myself to spend hundreds of dollars for official classes. A friend told me about Calm and I decided to try it. I was surprised by the high quality of the instruction. It's like having a guru, therapist, and wise friend all in one. After a week I decided to pay for the full version. Incredible value for money. I've meditated every day for two months and been able to bring mindfulness to many areas of my life - my job, eating habits, and social interactions. Those are all still a work in progress but becoming more aware of how my anxiety affects me in those settings is a huge first step. I also love the sleep stories and music. I love knowing that if I wake up in the middle of the night I have this great tool to help me break the gerbil wheel of worrying thoughts and fall back to sleep."
72,2019-09-24 02:41:10,5,"About a year ago, I was teetering on the edge of what felt like insanity. I had just moved to a new town, had no friends beyond my significant other, I was struggling to find work, I was deeply depressed, and considered suicide at one point. I was searching for help outside of what I knew, so I tried downloading this app. I accidentally purchased a years membership and was initially infuriated by the sudden lack of funds, as I was also struggling financially at the time. Little did I know, that this would be the start of one of the most important journeys I have ever embarked on. I started out slow and found that the daily calm meditations were helping me look outside of my own perspective of how terrible I thought life would always be. Today, I meditate daily, sometimes with the app, and sometimes without. I never imagined that I would be able to fit this into my daily routine, but I am so happy that I paid for that membership. I will definitely be renewing it for years to come."
73,2019-01-26 18:07:31,5,"I had been wanting to start meditating and wasn’t sure where to begin. While telling a friend this, she told me her holistic physician had suggested that she try the Calm App. I downloaded the app and began my Journey with Calm. It was a stressful time in my life. I wasn’t sleeping well and my thoughts were going so fast through my head. I used the sleep stories in those nights I had a hard time falling asleep or when I’d wake up and couldn’t go back to sleep. The sleep stories were very helpful. I also started meditating 10 minutes a day. There are a wide variety of meditations even on the free version. The app also helps keep you informed on how often you are using the App. There are specialists in different fields that do informative series. I could see how I was using my skills that the App taught me to help keep myself calm and present through the day, so I subscribed for the year. This opened up even more features. You have nothing to loose by trying Calm and everything to gain."
74,2021-01-06 20:42:57,5,"First let me say that while some reviews have requested more diverse voices for the daily meditations, In my case, I wish Tamara’s voice was used for everything including sleep stories as it’s the perfect formula to center me. I don’t know what it is, but her sleep stories put me to sleep in seconds.

I could write a lengthy review, but to summarize, this app brings me to center when I use it every time. I am someone who is always analyzing everything, wakes up in the middle of the night stressed about work or bills or family things, and misses the quiet within myself. I generally have difficulty sleeping through the night. But when I commit to mediations and sleep stories, it completely does the trick. It’s unbelievable, and I was a disbeliever before a friend recommended meditation with a different app which led me to Calm. It has so many tools to calm and center me so that I can sleep, be more effective at work, be happier in relationships, and be at peace within myself."
75,2020-12-06 16:59:27,5,"If you’re deciding between meditation apps, don’t worry I’ve already done it for you. I did the research and trial runs etc etc. But for me, Calm has consistently come out on top. What I like so much about the app is that it offers a very simple, daily practice that I can rely on each morning when I’m consistently practicing. However, for the days when I feel like I don’t want as much instruction, or the days when I need a two minute meditation, or the days when I think a walking meditation could be fun, Calm always seems to have something. They really mastered the balance between simple and dynamic in their design. I also really appreciate the new reflection feature, which I wouldn’t take it vantage of it if they didn’t slip it so seamlessly into the daily practice. What a great idea. Anyway, this is essentially my daily gratitude for the app itself because it’s been there for me through thick and thin and I recommend for anyone looking for some support in pausing :)"
76,2017-09-19 04:03:26,5,"After a year of nothing but stress, I felt that I needed a way to take control back and give myself some peace of mind, calm and some sleep. I tried the free version for a few weeks and loved it, so I went ahead and purchased it, and haven't looked back. I usually do the daily meditation in the morning and one of the program meditations at night, followed by a sleep story. While I still feel that I am not sure I am any better at meditating, I do feel more at peace and calmer.

I do wish for 2 things for this app: 1, that they tell you or give you an idea of what to do with your mind's eye once you close your eyes. For me, it is worse than my thoughts. But my husband and I came up with 2 different ""views"" (i.e. a meadow near a brook with dandelions to put my thoughts on and ""blow"" them away during my next breath - the visual of seeing them float away helps put them to rest). Now that I can focus on that I can focus easier on the breath.

And the 2nd thing I wish this app offered was a dairy of some sort. At the end of each session, you ask how it was, but I want to also comment on how I was - was I distracted, or did I feel that I improved. Being able to see the progress helps the progress along. It also would be a good thing to look back over and see if certain lessons need to be re-explored.

But even without those, I think the app is great and have enjoyed using it."
77,2018-03-30 16:34:38,1,"I’ve had this app for about 2 months and absolutely loved it until recently.  When I purchased it something happened and they charged me twice for the app.  There wasn’t a way to contact them so I asked my credit card company to reverse the charges and they did.  Coincidentally at almost the exact time that the charge was reversed my app started performing horribly - it started killing my battery, literally to zero, after only playing 1 story.  For example, reviewing the battery usage indicator on my iPhone 10 says I’ve used the app for 1 hour and used over 80% of my battery.  I have restarted my phone numerous times, loaded all the Calm updates, and have reported the issue to them via their help center.  I don’t believe in coincidences - I haven’t seen any reviews here that indicate this is an issue with anyone else.  This app developer must be a rouge programmer in his/her garage - scary stuff.  I’m going to get another refund if this performance problem doesn’t magically disappear.  And then I’m going to develop an app just like this to sell for a much cheaper price and compete with this product.  Shame on the price they charge for this app - that I have read in the reviews."
78,2018-03-05 18:18:32,1,"This is probably a wonderful app if you have the money for it. But I haven’t been able to figure out whether it would be worth the money, and now that they have pulled a sneaky trick I probably won’t. I had been trying it out while deciding whether to buy in and pay for “Premium.” I have liked the limited parts of the app I have been able to access, but was hesitating because the app is kind of expensive for me. Unfortunately, when the app was updated they locked some of the aspects that were previously open. This doesn’t seem to be in the spirit of the intention of the app. If it’s purpose is to bring more “calm” to the world, why would they do something so frustrating? There are other meditation apps out there, so I guess I’ll keep looking.
PS - After going back and looking at the reviews, I can see that this one review probably isn’t going to be noticed by anyone. There are only a few negative reviews, and like mine, they are mostly complaining about the high cost and the general ethos behind offering such an app at such a cost. Apparently this is a great app if you have the money for it, and there are a whole lot five-star reviewers who can afford it."
79,2021-01-08 04:51:57,5,"So, I have had a difficult time sleeping ALL👏 MY👏 LIFE! When I decided to try Calm, I was a bit skeptical because I had tried so many different apps, skills, and techniques in the past, and NOTHING worked. I was still up for HOURS at a time each and every night, and waking up with 5-6 hours of sleep each and every morning. When I downloaded Calm, I did not have the membership. I was a bit disappointed with how little I could do, and how expensive the membership was. But the investment was worth it! The sleep stories and meditations have me asleep in 30 minutes TOPS (with the help of some anti-anxiety and sleep pills). I also have depression and anxiety, and the guided meditations are amazing! Every morning, I stretch with the guided stretches, and I do the Daily Calm and check-ins each day. No matter how dedicated to mindfulness and meditation you would like to be, this app is worth your time and money. I feel so much happier and more well-rested. I give an 11/10!"
80,2020-07-24 12:01:01,5,"I got this app because American Express provided a year free, so I jumped on that opportunity. So far it’s been great to incorporate the Daily Calm into my morning. I work very early mornings (VIPKid teacher), so I actually do that after work at about 6:15 AM. During the day my daughter (3.5 years) likes the kids Sleepstories, which I was excited to find. I am also working on another degree so I listen to ambient sounds or focus music while I study. At night we read some physical books, do a shirt bible study, then I turn on a children’s Sleepstory from the calm app. After she falls asleep, which is pretty soon after the story begins, I put on my choice of Sleepstory. I’ve been recalling loving the train stories. I had no idea I would enjoy train sounds so much, but come to think of it I do remember my European travels and enjoying the train being s more valid form or transportation than it is in the US. But I digress. This is a great app and you should try it."
81,2020-10-26 13:22:47,3,"I am an insomniac and pay for this app to help me fall back asleep when I wake up in the night. I have found about A dozen stories on here that really work well for that. Those are the only ones which have soothing and not annoying voices, enjoyable content, and are written for adults.I wish there were more like this but this many are truly awesome and help me fall asleep when I wouldn’t have a chance without it. The other drawback to the app is that when your story ends you can’t just play it again without activating your brain much because it is always suggesting other stories or asking you to check in, it would be a lot better if it would just stay on the screen you’d chosen and all you would have to do is press play. Also I work in the wilderness during the summer so there’s no service at all. Sometimes I’m able to play the stories I have downloaded, but other times for some reason they all vanish from my liked page and some or all of them will not be playable from the all page either."
82,2018-05-04 17:45:51,5,"I've never been able to actually relax enough to meditate. Today, I didn't quit before giving it a true try. I experienced a sense of connection to life. A sweet calmness relaxed my heart rate and my muscles as well as my thinking.
I'm a believer in Jesus as the one savior. The entire bible is knit together too perfectly for it to have been a hoax. 
For the reason of being a Christian, I thought that true meditation would conflict. I believed that if one opened their mind to relaxation then it would allow for evil thoughts to sneak in.
This is NOT what I experienced. 
I simply continued to know my lord, and savior as I worked to relieve my self of the stress in my life. Therefore, allowing for meditation and Christianity to work as a powerful force to release the power of stress in my life. A way to look at my life one moment at a time. No overwhelming thoughts were given the power to ruin my moment, hours or day... I feel at peace and confident that God is ultimately in control!"
83,2021-02-23 13:46:36,5,"The app is a real game changer.  It helped/helps me so much with stress and my anxiety disorder.    I highly recommend it.  I’ve read several reviews that are disgruntled that you have to pay for it.  My recommendation- try out the free week.  Cancel on day 6 if you don’t like it.  It’s probably not for everyone, but I suspect if you’re reading reviews, you probably have issues with stress, anxiety, sleep etc. I think it will help you.  

(You can adjust the background sound volume and allow it to play in the background with the phone screen closed.  Click on the scenes icon at the top left to change the scene background music settings.)

Also I’m glad it’s a subscription with a fee.  Otherwise we’d be listening to commercials before each meditation session. Heck maybe even during the middle of a session.  This is someone’s living. Please stop asking them to work for free unless you do the same at your job."
84,2018-05-14 15:23:50,5,"The variety of meditation options in Calm means you will never be lost for a session regardless of why you’re seeking out a calming meditative escape. Pause your busy day and busy mind with everything from simple, low guidance sessions, set for the time you want and have available, or take a guided course that assists you with addressing an area of concern, like anxiety, depression, or just building resilience and gratitude skills. Calm now has masterclasses (which I intend to try soon!), meditations geared towards kids, and even bedtime stories, for those of us whose busy minds need a calm voice to lull us to sleep still. The calming bedtime sessions have helped me on numerous evenings when I thought I was going to be up way past my bedtime with insomnia. Instead, I quietly listened to someone reading a story, with tranquil ambient sounds, and was asleep minutes later. Give Calm a try, you have nothing to lose! The paid content is definitely worth the subscription price!"
85,2020-07-12 14:21:40,3,"This is a good app if you don’t have misophonia. The main daily meditation leader, Tamara Levitt, accentuates the sibilant s sounds at the end of words. Either she has a dental problem, or she feels this is calming (I hope she does not have a dental problem.) She also puts excessive smile in her voice. I feel like both of these problems could be fixed if she didn’t try so hard to sound like she’s leading a meditation. I’m sure she has a great voice if she would just not try so hard to sound “calming.”  The voice is excessively “sweet.” She actually sounds like an evil Disney character that’s pretending to be good. Other female readers and meditation leaders on the app do not have this problem. The voice irritates me so much that I can not listen to most of the meditations (and as you can tell, I need meditation) Anyway, there are some other meditation leaders but she is the main one. If you are ok with her voice, you’ll like the app. If you don’t you may still like some of the music, sleep stories, and other meditators. Just look for it on sale."
86,2018-11-12 23:16:08,4,"When I downloaded this app I was delighted at the surprising approach to relaxing at bedtime: Sleep stories for adults! Genius! At first I thought the idea was silly but was sold after a couple evenings of stories. I subscribed for the year. I was really looking forward to the Daily Calm, too. 

Stories with wonderful readers like Anna Acton and Stephen Fry are pure heaven. Sadly, it’s Tamara Levitt’s voice that made me cancel my subscription. I feel awful saying this but it’s true. What is perhaps an attempt to sound soothing comes across as phony affectation. It’s grating. As a result I can’t listen to the Daily Calm. When my partner chose a story read by her one evening he and I were just minutes in before he asked for one read by someone else (without me having expressed my opinion about her tone of voice). 

This is a solid app. If the content she curates is read by others, however, it would be a GREAT app. I would happily resubscribe if the readers and voices at Calm were less Tamara and more varied."
87,2020-07-14 08:28:49,5,"I suffer from anxiety ever since my first fish died, and I lost him. He was my favorite one of all of my fish, and now it’s kinda rough, he used to do little circles in the water whenever I entered the room after school. Calm helped me slow my thoughts down, and helped me get through it. It’s incredible how A little story, or music, or even just words, can help overcome what you are suffering through. Calm is A friend to me, always helping me get through stuff, and now, I still have anxiety, and am often anxious for one thing or another, but I am easily calmed down by calm. and am also very very very clumsy. So I burn myself or cut myself by accident. But calm helps. Giving relaxing words, music, or stories. I hope the makers of Calm and their workers should be very proud, helping people A crossed the world overcome fear, or anxiety, or depression, or guilt, and Etc. You guys are amazing. I wish one day, I can say thank you for everything, face to face. You guys are amazing!"
88,2021-01-25 05:22:50,2,"My toddler likes the Thomas the tank meditations. I got the premium subscription for $70 a year out of desperation to get my kiddo to sleep. Apparently I was pretty sleep deprived myself because I bought it twice, as explained by the company representative. One under the App Store and one online with an email. When I asked if she could stop one of them, she ghosted me. I still can’t seem to cancel one of them, and the other had been paid for the year anyway. It was one day until the free trial ended, and the rep refused to help me. Regardless of the content, which I don’t personally find helpful, I think ethically the company should not take advantage of people like that. I’ve led groups on mindfulness meditation for years as a therapist, and I think this content is just okay. Search for mindfulness meditations and lots of free videos will pop up. Or try reading or listening to real mindfulness like jon kabat-zin. Glad some people find this app useful, but I wish I’d never signed up. Paying for two premium subscriptions I barely use (and the one I can’t find auto renews!), feeling duped."
89,2019-07-09 02:18:01,5,"I’ve always been the kind of person who struggles falling asleep. I didn’t think that the sleep stories or the sleep music would help me, but boy was I wrong. At first I did all the free stuff. And then one night after going out to the couch and tossing and turning until 3 a.m. I kind of said screw it and paid the money for a years subscription. It seems like a lot of money, but broken down over an entire year it’s totally worth it!! 

I can not go to bed with out this thing, believe me I’ve tried! I sleep so restlessly without it. I don’t use it too much for the meditation, but I have and it’s wonderful. I mostly use it for sleep. I’ve found that I have favorite narrators that I like and I get so excited when my favorite narrator adds a new sleep story. 

I’m not someone who spends money willy nilly, but this was a very smart purchase and when my year is up I will be resubscribing. Just trust me, it will be worth every penny!"
90,2017-10-26 01:22:47,5,"❤️ the music! Especially Michael Denny's Invigorate under the Relax heading. Wish the visual background was 'live' i.e. moved IRT like Scenes do. (Sidenote: can't wait to VR this app up when that day comes.) Noticed I have used guided meditations less and less over the years of my sub. Which overall I do think is still a great value. But maybe switch it up and throw a dude on the track. Nothing against the female guides (assuming they are actual humans and not very good robot voices haha), but I wouldn't mind the variety. I can't be the only one to feel this way. Or are there male guided sessions somewhere in here that I just haven't found? Idk. I'm looking for something between Eckhart Tolle and a late night Pillow Talk FM-type DJ. Feel me? Not all the app feature updates are winners but I appreciate that the Calm team keeps trying to refine and improve. Makes it feel very much worth the price of subscription. PS- wrote this while lying in a clay ball sauna. 🤙"
91,2017-09-04 15:39:43,5,"I started meditating a over 2 years ago and went looking for an app to help shortly thereafter. The beginner guided sessions have walked me through the basics and getting better sleep. The deeper guided sessions start at 3 minutes and work up from there in great easy, workable increments. The daily Calm meditations are wonderful - all about 10 minutes long and give a bump to the variety of meditation available. The timed, unguided sessions are great once you know what you want to focus on. Sleep Stories include fiction and non-fiction read by a wide variety of people. There are tales in, what are to me, second languages, and they are amazing too! There's also music and ambient sounds with music. The most recent addition is 'Music' - this has 'Focus', 'Calm/Relax', 'Deep Sleep' and they seem to be different tones and patterns/wavelengths to help with those activities. I haven't used them much, but it's safe to say, this app is simply wonderful."
92,2020-06-12 18:23:24,5,"I love this app, I feel so relaxed absolutely love, love, love helps me get through life. Stress, worries, past failures. Not to focus on what is bogus. That there is a here and now the present moment. Looking back your past made you stronger and helped you learn in life. Don’t beat yourself up just breath & release. 

Wherever I am at, I can be in whatever mood. I can use this app and breathing techniques that this app helps me with. Life and work can be so delightful but stressful. I work with thee developmental disability so my work can be challenging in its self. Along with taking care of life when you get home, you have children and a husband that depends on you for so much. 

Sometimes I forget to take care of myself, I forget to breath. This is unhealthy I know. So when I seen that kaiser had this app. I downloaded it immediately and I have loved it ever since. I hope you love this app as much as me. I hope it helps you in so many ways. Peace, love & blessings."
93,2020-06-29 06:22:03,1,"One night, I was having a bad anxiety attack and I thought about downloading this app so I did and of course, i wasn’t thinking anything would be locked. As soon as I had got into my account, 90% of the stories were LOCKED. I was so mad because this is unfair to me. Basically everything is locked so this app is not for me and I’m very disappointed. If this app is for helping people, why should mostly everything be locked?! And I have to pay 70 dollars for premium? That’s ridiculous!! I don’t have much self-esteem and the self esteem stories were all locked, so I am pretty mad about that. I wanted to try a song. EVERY STORY IS LOCKED. I wanted to try a meditate story. EVERY STORY IS LOCKED. I wanted to try a sleeping story. ONLY 4 STORIES UNLOCKED. Do you not think that this is fair? I’ve listen to all the stories that are unlocked without premium and I have to re-listen to them because everything is basically locked. This app is great and all, but basically everything is locked. The stories are good, but I have to listen to the same ones. Please unlock more. That’s why I’m giving it a 1 star and a negative review."
94,2020-04-04 16:53:10,5,"What I’ve observed is motivation works differently for different people. Watching daily motivation quotes can work for someone, while watching some leader’s videos can do for some. But during all these media consumption phase we all are neglecting to care about what our brains want to tell us. We can only listen to our brains when we give attention to our thoughts. What do we think? how often are we getting distracted? how we cant even keep simple counts of breath as we breath as we are taken away with random thoughts. This can be realized as you spend quality time with yourself in a meditative state. I installed Calm with a bit of skepticism in mind that how can another media on a device help me not get distracted. But looks like it guides you well enough to have you introspect yourself, motivate you and gives a moment of self realization which you will definitely feel missed as you discover it. Great work team Calm!"
95,2018-10-12 17:44:40,1,"After trying this app for a few days, I was in a moment of stress and signed up for the 7-day free trial early this morning. After I agreed to have $60 charged in the App Store after the free trial, the Calm app did not unlock its content for me. I quit the app and tried again. No success.  I went to manage by subscription and hit “restore” within the app, but it said “no account found.” I then logged out and tried to long in again— but the app wouldn’t let me log in, saying “bad gateway”. I then tried to change my password, but I got an error message saying “there is a problem resetting your password.” I deleted the app and reinstalled it from App Store. Again no luck logging in— even though the App Store says I have a free trial and I’ll be charged $60 after 7 days. Great. I can’t even access the app to cancel this recurring subscription. Their website doesn’t work and I can’t contact them. I will have to take this up with my credit card company. The Calm developers are CROOKS and SCAMMED me out of money. I wanted to use it to get back to sleep, but it’s made me anything but calm! STAY AWAY and choose a different app!!!!"
96,2020-02-09 10:16:18,5,"This is such a well-rounded, thoughtfully created, educational, and inspiring tool for learning Mindfulness, reaping the benefits of it, and keeping it in everyday practice. Tamara Levitt is a wonderful coach, and I find her focused mini-practices extremely helpful. “The Daily Calm” sessions are a nice way to start the day, and help me stay on track with my practice. I attended a weekly mindfulness group for over a year, and it helped me overcome some issues that I had been dealing with for decades. This app served as an adjunct to my weekly meetings, and nowadays, it’s a part of my daily routine. Whatever negative issue you might be dealing with, there’s no-nonsense help here. Sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, overeating, judgment, self-doubt, lack of motivation, boredom, and many other topics are covered, and can be cherry-picked to suit the most emergent need, or merely followed in the modules. I find it very useful for getting energized, sparking my creativity, or winding down from the day."
97,2020-06-16 03:42:27,5,"This app has something for you regardless if you’re a beginner or if you’ve been walking the path your whole life. The guided meditations are fine, but if you’re not into that, there’s a lot more on offer here. 
This app has showed me that bedtime stories are such an underrated category of content. Wonder read by Matthew McConaughey is probably the most beautiful thing I’ve ever listened to. That collection of content alone is almost worth the price. 
The included Masterclass content on psychology is brilliant. The soundscapes are good and all the ones I’ve tried loop very smoothly, if they loop at all, which I figure they must...but I digress. 
This app offers a lot of content for its price. Which, admittedly, does seem very steep at first, until you realize how much you’re getting. 
There is a lot to this app and I wish I could recommend it to everyone but that price point is a little scary for a lot of people I’d imagine."
98,2020-04-16 16:57:39,5,"I have tried a couple of different apps. I used the Insight Timer, but as a beginning meditator, felt I needed more guidance. I did Headspace for a year. I really like the Headspace guy (Andy). His voice is nice, he has good insights and knows his stuff. I liked the basics, which is what you start with. There was one visualization that he uses ALOT (liquid sunlight) that just didn’t work for me, so that was a bummer, but I liked the rest. But after that, HS wants to lock you into packs (or mini classes) like stress, depression, overeating, etc. I didn’t like that. I just want a daily overall practice. 
I tried Calm and it was exactly what I wanted. The app is easy to use, Tamara also has a nice voice, and talks just enough. It’s not religion based, which is better for me; rather, it draws from all sorts of philosophies. It has soothing background sounds and sleep stories, as well as different ambient music choices. I REALLY like it and bought a lifetime membership!"
99,2021-02-16 06:06:33,5,"I don’t know what I’d do without this app. I’m a life long somewhat insomniac that cannot fall asleep unless I have something that “occupies” my brain, so I can turn off all the junk I worry about. These stories are highly entertaining, and very interesting, yet calming at the same time. They’re also educational! I’ve learned many things from around the world that I didn’t know before. Most nights I’m out after 2-5 minutes, but some take longer. If I wake up during the night, I simply start a new story and I’m asleep again. I have my favorite narrators too. I find that male voices with accents other than American (with the exception of Erik Brah and Alan Sklar) really lull me to sleep. I need a deep voice lol. Females with British, Asian, Indian accents are great for me too. There’s also calming nature sounds and spa music. I’ve been using the Calm app for 2 years now and it never disappoints! Now I don’t have to reach for the Xanax anymore!"

101,2017-09-22 16:13:00,5,"[September update: I still use this app on a daily basis, including the new Sleep stories and music. I can't recommend this app highly enough. It is making a big impact in my life and my ability to deal with changes in our country and politics.] I highly recommend the Calm App, especially the basic subscription model. After learning meditation basics from the free versions, I realized that I needed more and subscribed more than a year ago. The Daily Calm meditation, each on a different but related theme, makes it possible to practice on a daily basis. The meditation leader presents lovely thoughtful meditations, with an appropriate quotation. There are numerous meditations focused on different issues such as anxiety, compassion, and loving kindness. The lovely images and sounds furnish calming and focusing backgrounds. The new sleep stories module has really helped with my middle of the night insomnia.

I highly recommend the Calm App."
102,2020-02-06 23:58:07,1,"The system for managing subscriptions and payments through Apple unnecessarily complicates the process to unsubscribe for users. To unsubscribe, we must navigate through the app to find a single link that then directs us to the store that directs us to another page where we can then finally unsubscribe from a single link buried between a list of probably 30 different options. This is poor business ethic that deliberately obscures the process in hopes that users will simply give up and allow payment to be processed.

 I went through the process once upon the end of my trial subscription and must have hit the wrong button because I was charged $70 the next day. My request for refund from Apple was run through an algorithm that quickly informed me that my purchase does not meet the requirement for a refund. 

Listen. I tried this app ONCE and did not enjoy it. I never used it again. And now I’m stuck with it? Bad business. Shame on Apple. As for Calm, this is about as calm as it gets when your customers take the time to write an actual critical and constructive review.  Y’all should really think about fixing this."
103,2018-11-07 12:08:02,4,"Calm has a good selection of soothing background audios to ensure an environment conducive for stabilizing the mind.  The reminders help those that struggle with maintaining a regular regimen of taking time out for mindfulness.  Getting them to stop doesn’t always work, but maybe that is part of the point.  The free edition has sufficient features for anyone curious about experiencing mindfulness, yet the add-ons are probably not a necessary.  “Mindfulness” in itself has become a buzz word apparently coined by amateurs, and practices have mixed and matched true authentic, effective techniques to make for better marketing and adoption.  So if you subscribe to the guided features, you won’t realize the true benefits of what mindfulness is after.  Yet, the tool is excellent for helping you achieve a rhythm with some reminders if you have a real authentic mindfulness coach that knows more than just theory (and amateur practice) but has achieved mystic capabilities through mastery of the authentic techniques."
104,2020-11-01 05:36:37,2,"I’ve been a subscriber for over a year and have used the app almost daily during most of that time concurrent with my own journaling practice in Day One. I always loved opening the app and seeing the reminder to take a deep breath, and then feeling like I was somewhere else, somewhere calm. It made it easier to focus and meditate. But now all of that is gone, the “place” I went is gone, and the app is just another cluttered, stressful place of mental noise. Calm has added fragmented journaling options, which I guess is nice for any who wish them, but I will not trust my thoughts to their app, because that is essentially what it would be. Unlike Day One, they have no export feature or backups, and these recent events have not exactly made me trust them. A lot of materials are gone as well, though I can’t be sure of what all of it was. My arthritic thumbs don’t appreciate the new side-swiping menus for the sleep stories either. I wish I had not updated the app. I don’t know if I will keep my subscription; most of what is left is Tamara, Tamara, and Tamara."
105,2020-05-10 04:23:03,4,"First of all I’ve recommended this app to multiple friends who have purchased a subscription. We all think it is great for helping us relax, reduce anxiety and fall asleep. However, I periodically have issues with my phone not charging properly when the app is open so I asked my husband to download so we could trade off who’s phone plays the calm at night. I was very disappointed to find out that our 1 year subscription could not be shared. It basically makes the “family sharing” pointless. My question to the developer is, will it really hurt your business that much to allow family members to share one subscription? I’ve had this for over a year and this is the first time I’ve even tried to share it with someone in my family list. It is not a cheap subscription but if it is going to hurt your business, then limit it to x amount of shares or offer the second subscription for a discount. Just a few thoughts. Otherwise. Great app."
106,2017-12-11 03:45:02,5,"I struggle with anxiety and depression, plus the related insomnia. My doctors have all recommended meditation but I couldn’t ever figure out how to do it. The guidance on this app, however, finally made the connection for me. I’ve learned how to quiet my mind without additional medication. Not saying all my problems are gone - just that I have a new tool to help me cope. 

And the sleep stories are the best! Anytime the brain won’t let me sleep, I turn a sleep story on. It engages my mind enough to distract it from the litany of worries, stresses, and reminders of middle school embarrassments. I love the wide variety of narrators and subject matter.

One other thing... when I began looking for a meditation app, I really wanted to avoid any that promoted specific spiritual or religious practices. I haven’t come across anything like that in Calm. I can fold these meditations into my own beliefs/traditions without feeling stressed that they’re in conflict with one another."
107,2017-09-15 18:43:55,5,"I am using a variety of tools to assist with my personal growth and development. I have my work cut out for me. I've had this wonderful app for a couple of weeks. I started with the sleep stories and at first I couldn't do it every night. There was almost a week between the first and second time. Last night there was only a day between, and only a day between the one before that. I know that may sound insignificant but for me that is HUGE. I'm committed to doing the sleep every day, even when I work at night and I'm actually sleeping during the day. I am feeling the improvement in the quality of my sleep. Today I will also try the breathing and focus.

I tend not to rate apps, but for some reason I'm feeling compelled to with this one even though I haven't been using it long. I'm pretty sure I'll be back with periodic updates. Btw, I gave 4 stars (vs 5) to leave room for improvement.💜"
108,2020-04-07 23:35:25,5,"I’ve heard about Calm for a while now & remember seeing commercials but never thought to give it a try until recently and all I can say is WOW! Wish I got this months ago! With the virus lockdown I’ve recently started to experience anxiety and panic attacks that I haven’t had since college (15 yrs ago). I tried my usual solo breathing & meditation techniques but they’re just not As effective as it used to be. I then started looking for meditation apps and thought I’d give this a try. SO glad I did! They have several categories from anxiety & stress relief to sleep aid sessions. All so very soothing, relaxing and 100% effective-I’m hooked! Also, I used to listen to gentle water or instrumental sounds to help me fall asleep but this app works so much better & faster. Definitely worth every penny and an absolute must to help with your mental health during this stressful & depressing pandemic. I am so grateful for Calm! :)"
109,2019-05-02 19:20:55,5,"I can’t say enough about how healing this app is. I began practicing meditation with it following a concussion, and it did help. Then after, I kept with the practice prior to sleep, as I often stayed awake with racing thoughts. The Sleep Stories and meditations offered knocked me out every time. Still later, I really began practicing meditation during the day with the Daily Calms and other sessions. These have probably been the most valuable to my daily life. Much of the exhaustion I was experiencing that I thought was due to lack of sleep I believe now was due more to stress. Repeated practice of mindfulness has increased my calm, my awareness, my clarity, and my happiness. The guided lessons are akin to cognitive behavioral therapy, very poignant and always kind. There is no wrong way to practice this. There is no failing. There is no order that must be followed or schedule adhered to. There is only the benefit of the more you use it, the better you feel."
110,2020-02-06 22:41:02,5,"Thanks for this fantastic app. I got this to aid in sleep while on international travel. That was ok but then I browsed the rest of the app and got interested in the meditation. Health providers have encouraged me for years to do this but I always assumed my mind was not disciplined enough for the practice. Enter Jeff Warren’s 30 Day course. I was hooked from my first “sit”. Bringing your mind back to your focus without judgment and with compassion towards yourself is such a simple but powerful concept. I completed that course and have done others on managing pain and self esteem, as well as daily guides. I have even just used the timed meditation feature and ventured out on my own. I am a metrics kind of gal and I can report a data backed improvement in my resting heart rate. I wear a ring tracker and my sleep and RHR scores are improved.  Sorry to run on and on....this is a fantastic app for me and I hope you try it. Anyone can meditate."
111,2021-02-15 11:52:29,3,"I have the paid version, and particularly like the sleep stories. They work so well, I usually fall asleep before the story ends. Problem is, I might wake up again a few hours later and want to pick up the story where I left off. But instead, I see the “Still Awake?” pop-up window suggesting other stories I might try, or maybe a meditation, and a pop-up asking if I’d like to rate that session, keep track of streaks and stats, etc. No, I’d really just like to find the sleep story I was listening to, but it has vanished from my screen. Now I’ve got to sit up in bed, grab my reading glasses, X out of the intrusive pop-ups, and scroll through to re-find the sleep story that was snatched away from me....leaving me not at all calm, but instead, annoyed and anxious, and now unable to fall back to sleep. Can you please provide a way to turn off these very unhelpful “helpful suggestions” and gamification features? For me, they are defeating the entire purpose of this app, to CALMLY fall asleep."
112,2021-01-28 13:22:39,4,"This is the best meditation app I’ve tried. I use it 1–2 times a day. Great mix of content and teachers for different moods, goals, and time commitments. While the sleep meditations work for me, I find the sleep stories with celebrity narration too distracting and gimmicky to fall asleep to, but I know others users for whom this is their favorite feature. Calm offers a series of sequential programs for mindfulness skill-building: “7 Days of ______,” where the next day’s content unlocks with the completion of the previous day’s. As a paying user, I wish there were a way to override this. I once exited a minute early, when the wrap-up was nearly over, because I had to leave, and the app made me redo that day to access the next meditation. Similarly, I just updated versions and lost three days’ progress in a program. I think the only way to catch up is to let them play out with the volume off, which is a waste of time and energy."
113,2020-01-30 04:20:46,5,"i love this app so much. i was not someone who meditated or anything at all, i took a stress management class in college and we learned how to meditate. after that class, i felt i was having a hard time without any guided meditations, as i have ADD, and GAD, and have a hard time keeping my thoughts straight. i found this app, used the free version for a bit, and loved it so much that i decided to try the full version. i am currently on year two of using this app and i could not be more thankful for it. i have learned so much about myself. the ONLY thing i was thinking about today, was how cool, and probably impossible, it would be to be able to get it as an app on my Roku TV, and listen to my sleep stories and meditate through there. i’m sure apple TV has it, and i love listening to david attenborough on Our Planet, but it’d be awesome to be able to listen to the meditations on a TV!"
114,2018-04-22 15:17:09,5,"I struggled with horrible PTSD symptoms for years now. It was difficult to apply mindfulness to my everyday routine until I found this app. It has greatly reduced my physical and mental symptoms by allowing me to become aware, ride the waves and let go of emotion. I’m not going to say it’s a cure because there is no such thing. I view it as a tool to maintain your mental fitness like a treadmill and exercise helps maintain your physical fitness. Gradually over time your mind becomes stronger and more capable but mindfulness like physical exercise should become part of your routine so you can keep optimum mental fitness. Also, I was on medication and no longer require it yet it doesn’t mean anyone should stop taking their medication. I suggest to start doing mindfulness and as you progress there may be a reduction to your prescription and eventually you may be able to come off of them. Hope this is helpful! God bless!"
115,2019-09-23 07:07:52,2,"Several years ago a therapist recommended Calm to me, as a person living with anxiety and mood disorders. I was skeptical but it changed my life, and helped me through a period of intense trauma.

However, the app has gotten bloated with content and absolutely unusable. It would be so simple to let users re-order meditations so their favorites are shown first, or select what is shown on the home screen and bottom buttons (for example, I never use music, but I loved the breathe bubble, which I have no choice but to keep hidden in the settings menu).

Without the option for customization, the app is counterproductive. I chose Calm over competitiors because of its soothing simplicity. Now it feels like I’m being controlled, and being sold someone else’s idea of “mindfulness.” If your goal is to make mental health the new physical health or whatever your slogan is, try to remember the most important principle of mental health professionals everywhere: I, not you, am the expert on me. Your job is to work with me, not tell me what you think I need."
116,2017-10-31 03:43:14,5,"I’m rarely the type to review an app and I’m even less likely to purchase the full version of an app — in the case of this app, I’ve done both which should really be a testament to how much I truly appreciate this app and all its features. After long bout with insomnia and unable to “shut down” my brain at night I downloaded this app and used the free features for a couple of weeks. The sleep stories lulled me to sleep and I was able to meditate after some intense anxiety. I finally purchased the full version and am so glad I did. No matter my mood or my goal (sleep, focus, or lessen anxiety) it has something for me and there’s so much content I never feel like it’s not worth it. I love the voice overs and guided meditations don’t feel forced. I’m brand new to this and I can see myself feeling better the more I use it. I look forward to it every night. A huge thanks to the makers of this app."
117,2019-12-20 03:16:28,5,I got this last Christmas Eve. Used it for a while... I decided to try it again before canceling my subscription. Reminded me how great the daily calm is. I love Tamara’s voice and it’s a wonderful way to start your day. And then I discovered the Master classes. Don’t know if I overlooked these when I first got the app or if it’s been added. Listened to Elizabeth Gilbert’s and was blown away. Just fantastic. Honestly either one of these is worth the price of admission. And to have both?! Plus other features I haven’t explored yet. Honestly I’m glad there is a subscription fee because it made me revisit this amazing tool. I am using it every day again and it really is making a positive impact on my mood and overall feeling of happiness. Worth every penny. If you are ready to be good to yourself give it a try. Thanks so much to everyone who created this app and is participating. You have my sincere gratitude and love
118,2020-09-10 01:35:15,2,"I love the idea of the app but I can’t afford it. I have trouble falling asleep when my boyfriend is out of town so I was looking into the app and the sleep stories and calming noises sounded awesome but I personally can’t afford a yearly subscription for unlimited access. If there were even 5-10 options for every single thing, the app would probably have more downloads. Or, a monthly $2-$5 subscription rather than it’s all coming out at once. It would save $10 a year minimum. And up to almost $50 a year. The app might even make more money and be able to reach poor teens who can’t afford stuff like myself. I have one subscription (that isn’t a bill). I can afford 2 $75+ subscriptions a year. I just wish is was more available to a majority of teens and young people or even busy parents who can’t afford stuff for themselves. A cheaper option might be great. Or do a 30second add before each story to make money and the upgrade includes no ads. Just some ideas from a poor teen that can barely pay bills and eat spaghettios twice a week..."
119,2020-08-12 11:34:17,3,"I purchased the premium app a few months ago and was able to use it a few times. The wi-fi at my house is satellite, so sometimes stories will not load or the app freezes. I had to get a new phone recently due to my old one getting hot, the screen dying, and eventually die altogether.

So, with my NEW phone, I download the app and within 2 minutes of it loading and scrolling through stories my phone feels super hot to touch. I paid for the year, so wanted to be able to use the app. Though, I don’t relish the idea of ruining  my phone in the process. I never noticed previously when my case was on the phone, but it hurt my hand how hot it became. So, can only imagine after running sounds or a story for a while what could happen over time. 

I love your UI, the content is great, the heavy load and CPU performance could certainly use work. I’d be equally happy with less fancy animations and graphics if it meant it was faster and didn’t run the risk of destroying my processor."
120,2020-06-16 10:04:22,5,"Today I began a free trial to “Calm.” I am impressed with its quality of content and the wide range of its content. Its images and sounds are exceptional for calming and inspiring. The voices sound like a therapist guiding you in relaxation, mindfulness, and peace. The reminders and daily practices help one to establish healthy daily routines and habits that have the potential to improve the quality of mental health and its frequency and duration. And these are my positive first impressions of the APP “Calm” after a brief 15-20 minute experience using it for the first time! I am looking forward to exploring more of its features and using them on a daily basis. I recommend that therapists and life coaches introduce this APP to their clients especially with those clients that are anxious, stressed, or angry. Well done to the developers of “Calm,” you have created a professional mental health APP that will improve the mental health, happiness, and peace of its habitual users!"
121,2018-04-30 13:02:29,5,"Mind you, you can’t unlock all the features right away, or unless you pay or happen to have a ton of time on your hands, but this app was my favorite download of the year. You can meditate, listen to calming sessions, or music, and even choose your own scenes/background, which not only have accompanied sound, but also videos of corresponding scenes of nature and whatnot. My favorites are Pouring Rain, Tropical Beach, Passing Clouds, Coastline at Sunset, Foggy Steam, Thunderstorm, Evening Crickets, and Summer Meadow. They even have ones like; Fireplace, Zen Ocean, Falling Raindrops, Rhythmic Waves, Woodland Lake, Plains of Wheat, Mystic Fountain and Mountain Lake. I know there’s more but I suggest checking out this seriously cool App! Along with the Sleep Stories, relaxing music, focus training, and meditation for beginners, stress, relationships, sleep, emotions, and so on...this App is what you need at the end of any type of day, what we all need is a little Calm!"
122,2018-01-10 02:02:41,5,"As someone that suffers from depression and anxiety, this app has worked wonders for me. I’d never given serious consideration to meditation, I always had it on my to do list, occasionally trying on my own for a few minutes.

This app changed all that. After the first 12 minute meditation/lesson in anxiety at the end of a hectic and stressful day, the negative feelings melted right away. It also has soothing music for sleeping for when I’m suffering from insomnia, or even bedtime stories. Which makes me feel 6 years old saying, but feeling 6 for a little before bed is surprisingly awesome!

It is pricey for an app subscription at $60 a year... but in my humble opinion, it’s well worth it if you suffer from anxiety like myself. That’s only $5 a month for some piece of mind. Have one less beer a month or save some other way, because this will be some of the best $60 you ever spent."
123,2018-02-14 10:59:43,5,"I bought this because I’m terrible at meditation and mindfulness.  I needed something to keep me focused on my meditation.  

Initially, I struggled a bit with the voice of the person guiding the session, but once I got used to hearing her, it was much easier.  Other people and other stories and classes sounded different. 

I use the daily calm almost every day. the lessons in the meditation so often are reinforcing what I’m learning and hearing in another part of my life.  Very useful quotes at the end to remind me what the lesson was about.  Often I will screenshot the quote and picture and share it with friends.  

I love the variety of sounds I can select and how there is a visual with each.  

I recently listened to the Breaking Bad Habits addiction class and really felt as though I was at a seminar for psychologists and neuroscientists.  It was amazing what I learned.  I have a daughter who is a neuroscience and psych major in college. I had to share it with her.  

I’ve also been stepping through the various meditations on self care, relationships, etc and those also have been enormously helpful.  

Sometimes my daughter can’t sleep so she listens to the stories on there.  I love that there are classics mixed in with new ones I had never heard of. 

Best $60 bucks I’ve ever spent on an app like this.  Thank you, Calm."
124,2019-02-28 17:34:35,5,"Migraine, fibromyalgia, genetic anxiety...all contributors to my struggles with falling asleep. I don’t remember the first place I saw Calm advertised but it popped into my head about three weeks ago and has already done wonders. Right now I’m mainly using the Music category and selecting either Sleep which are very gentle music compositions or Soundscapes which are different sounds from nature. There is so much to choose from depending on your needs.....sleep, energy, meditation, putting a child to sleep, yoga background sounds.....I’ve only scratched the surface. What I have used has helped me focus on the sound instead of my pain or what I’m concerned about. I set it for 30 minutes and I fall to sleep before it’s over. Before this I was lying awake for 2-3 hours and sometimes more.....like all night long. I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants a little more peace in their life."
125,2018-04-30 11:12:21,5,"•allow a que: when i fall asleep, it’d be nice to align a que to automatically go from a sleep meditation practice, to a sleep story, to music without having to exit my trance to open my phone and do it myself.
•add things to listen to during workouts: it would be awesome to have a breathing regimen to listen to with some upbeat simple background music. i would love to hear this calming voice guide me through breathing while i’m working out- maybe allow it to play over music we have playing in other apps if possible. simple upbeat “elevator” music would even be great.

otherwise- this app grounds me, centers me, and makes me calm. i can actually appreciate the meditation programs, and don’t find them to be corny or tenuous. 100% worth the money for full access for a YEAR!! i love it, thank you creators for helping with my negative mindset. and i LOVE the voice, i hope you never change her!"
126,2020-03-27 13:32:41,5,"Calm is such an incredible app. There is always something new to explore and all the features are really cool. The simple and East to use format is perfect for people with anxiety who get overwhelmed. Even though there are tons of choices, Calm makes it easy to narrow down the choices and help you find exactly what you are looking for. Calm customizes your recommendations based on how you are feeling that day and what you want to get out of the app. It has stuff for the whole family including a kids section.  You do have to pay $70 a year for premium, however that’s only a little less than $6 per month. My family compared it to being less than Netflix. The price is totally worth it for all the features it comes with. I would definitely recommend  this app to anyone with anxiety or anyone who just needs to make time in their day for mindfulness."
127,2018-04-07 07:22:17,4,"This app is amazing and helps me fall asleep very quickly, the voices are amazing and so is the scenery, pictures and music this app gives. I use the sleep story a lot at night and I really think you guys should unlock premium stories for a couple days because I am so use to hearing “The Waterfall,” “Blue and Gold,” and “The Secret Lagoon.” I am 100% not saying they are bad stories because they are amazing. I just wish I could choose from different stories every once in a while instead of hearing the same stories over and over again each night. I also wanted to speak about the pricing, it is a little too over priced, mind you, I’m only 15 and there would be no way I could ever pay that price without a card of some sort. I overall love the app, from the start the story to finish, this is absolutely one of the best sleep story and meditation app I have ever downloaded. 4 Stars since the pricing and locked stories."
128,2018-10-21 13:04:19,5,"I believe this is a great APP except that they’ve make no effort to respond to 3 concerns in emails via their support tickets 

The first one that I made some time ago was that I found it extremely difficult in the middle of the night to see the icons or read anything without glasses. I asked if they could make them little bit larger for  those of us who cannot see well at night without reading glasses. They never responded, in fact with in a few weeks they made the reading icons even more difficult to read.

Being a neuroscientist I recommended this app to my patients. Many of them complained of this difficulty and so I once again wrote a support ticket. They Never responded.
They also changed the voice of the Female narrator for the meditations and put a background noise which is constant. This may be easy for some people to hear her voice without difficulty But I find it impossible. Background sound rushing water perhaps like Niagara Falls. Very difficult to concentrate and hear her voice clearly.  I am a 20+ year veteran meditator and find this new sound agitating 
I explained it was difficult and asked if they would turn the volume down. The Never responded and made no change.

An App is only as good as the support. Which seems to be absent.  Too bad it is otherwise a good idea."
129,2018-01-08 23:24:30,5,"I love this app so much, and cannot begin to tell you how much it has helped me. An addition that I would love to see is the ability to go back to a daily calm that one has missed. I tend to meditate at night before bed, but if that doesn't happen before midnight, or I miss my 24hr window, I lose that Daily Calm. Then I feel terrible that I've missed it for that day. For example, yesterday's was about Practice... I'm a classical musician, and practice is a necessary evil, however I didn't get to meditate until it was too late, and it was no longer accessible. 

Also, why not make the daily calm a part of a larger accessible archive for subscribers, so that one may focus on a particular issue that needs work or focus, vs just a small selection of a few daily calms. For the steep cost of the subscription, that would really make me very very happy. Thank you for considering my ideas."
130,2019-08-03 20:13:02,5,"In 2017 I started feeling guided to meditate for the first time. I sat down on the floor & started a 20 minute session. Let’s just say I didn’t even make it to 4 minutes. It felt like forever. I felt lost when it came to meditation. But eventually I came across the Calm app. 

I did the free meditations & loved them. But I also wanted to do just my own meditations. Just focusing on my breathing. So I started with one minute, then the next day two minutes, then the next three, then four, then five. & kept building up each day until I got to fifteen minutes & that’s how long I meditate now. 

The Calm app’s timer is so soothing. It’s not loud. It doesn’t make me jump when I hear it (I have anxiety). It’s perfect. 

In February of 2019 I decided that I was going to do a 30 day meditation challenge (15 mins per day). & being able to see my “streak” encouraged me so much. I did it! Which was so huge for me. 

But now I’m here in August & I’m currently on a 30 challenge but I want to go further. I want to go all the way until Jan. 1st, 2020 & then start building up to 30 minutes a day. 

I do not use be Calm subscriptions as I just do not have the money for it right now. But the free things that Calm offers? Incredible. 

Thank you, Calm, for your app! Also thank you for responding when I tag you in my insta stories! 

5 stars. Amazing. Thank you!"
131,2021-03-02 11:22:43,4,"Has some lovely calming images and sounds, and the unlocked bedtime story to which I listened had a a soothing voice. There many unlocked sessions I would like to hear and wish the owners would at least give a sample of the voice and then allow me to purchase the episode to own it, rather than requiring  a pricey (for me) yearly  subscription, for which the product is forever gone when it runs out. I know subscriptions are becoming the way of the world, but still I resist!  I do believe people should be paid for their work; I’d just like to be able to actually purchase a product; I would rate five stars if they would allow this. 

“Calm” has a nice daily feature (one of the few push notifications I allow on my phone) which reminds me to stay in the moment, breathe, etc.   The app has some generous free offerings and I thank thank the developers for sharing these!"
132,2020-05-29 18:28:09,3,"I used Calm for quite a while, and there were a lot of things I liked about it, and a lot of things I didn’t. One of the things I love about Calm are the sleep stories which always helped me relax. I also liked the guided meditations by Tara Brach. I have very sensitive ears, especially when it comes to human voices, so I’m very particular about the voice. I didn’t like Tamara Levitt’s voice at all, and found it was way too sweet for me. Like a kindergarten teacher: “Now Wiggle your feetsies and toesies”. Ugh. after a while it ended up getting on my nerves abit. I realize this is more is about me than the teacher, but I guess we all have our preferences. Also I just like Headspace better. They have lots of videos, workouts, and advice vids that help you make a more comprehensive and integrated practice. I also find Andy to be a far more precise and technically minded teacher, which helps people like me who are very analytical and really like to think about things."
133,2018-03-04 04:14:27,5,"This app has changed my life. Her voice is so incredibly soothing and beautiful, there’s different time settings 2 mins 5 mins 10 minutes. My life is so insanely stressful and hectic the only thing keeping me sane are her breathing techniques. What I also love is she doesn’t talk about wacko weird topics, she gives beautiful life messages that you can carry with you through he day. I clicked the increase focus and it REALLY helped me stop the distractions that we’re wasting my time. I’ve had the app since Feb 9, today is March 3 and I have done over 4 hours of total meditation.  I want to keep this app forever and worth every single penny I recommend this for EVERYONE to improve the quality of their life and to be able to decrease some of their stress. My body is at ease every time I finish a session whether it be 2 Mins or 20 mins"
134,2018-03-08 07:04:17,4,"I absolutely love this app. I have OCD and constantly struggle with anxiety. I’ve learned to deal with it better during the day, but at night, since I’m laying still, I have time to stop and think. Which turns into worrying and panic attacks. I usually take sleeping medicine for it, but then I started using the bedtime story part of the app, and it helped me to relax and fall asleep without having to take medication. Only thing is the pricing. I’m a college student and a part time nanny, and the pricing to unlock the full app is insane. I would love to continue to use the app since it’s helped me so much, but I only have to option of 3 stories to listen to, and it’s starting to drive me crazy I’ve heard them so much. Even though I love this app, I’m not using it anymore, and will probably delete it. If they could lower their prices to where more people have the option to use the full app, I think it could really flourish."
135,2017-12-11 18:35:18,5,"Never before believed in meditation.  Downloaded Calm because I just wanted the nature sounds but ended up trying the 7 day free course.  Amazing.  Purchased a subscription right away.

I can’t believe that I need this app.  Expensive for my budget but it’s helped me so much on problems I never knew I had.  I’m a digitally addicted recent father and it helped me through the previously mind-numbing chore of taking care of a 1yo.  I was doing a good job but that didn’t mean I wasn’t screaming inside my head from boredom.  It helped me be present rather than distracted because apparently I’m distracted by everything.  Did not know this.  Helped me not get upset over stupid things at work.  Lessons my anxiety a little bit.  

Feature request, auto shut off.  I’ve fallen asleep sometimes if at night and my phone died because app still running and my phone is my alarm."
136,2020-02-24 13:42:10,5,"I have been engaged with Calm for approximately two months. Tools within the app I have used include Daily Calm, Sleep Stories, musical selections and Mindfulness meditations focused on increased levels of practice tied to a specific set of behaviors. I am learning that active pursuit of mindfulness combined with my spiritual journey, is accelerating self awareness and self improvement, acceptance, patience and love towards others and an overall sense of accepting life’s ups and downs in a non-judgmental way. I find this is freeing my mind to enjoy each day more fully. My wife is amazed with changes in my words and actions. If you are engaged in Calm, I say congratulations and good for you, your family and friends. If you are in the process of beginning your own journey into deeper understanding of yourself and your world, I encourage you to make regular use of Calm and the resources it will afford you. 
Jim"
137,2020-08-21 05:30:08,2,"I downloaded this app because I felt it would help me sleep better at night and avoid my everlasting thoughts. The first night using the app was cool. I have only used it twice since downloading it. Today, I check my mail and it says it was renewed for $84 for a year!!! I know in my mind that I don’t select the subscription for $79. Who has that kind of money to spend on an app? Especially during an pandemic. People are out of work & can definitely use $84 for food & survival items. I think I was well taken advantage of because it was automatically set for 1 year subscription. Instead of asking if I would like to subscribe for another week, 1 month or 2 months, it was automatically set for one year. This app shows they’re just for the money. You can tell from the limited stories and soundscapes that they have. For $80 I should have more than just 12 soundscapes to help with my sleep. So now i'm forced to use the app for a year with limited soundscapes and honestly I didn’t even care for the app."
138,2018-01-10 08:19:21,4,"Still love the app but wish they would add more sleep stories. Not meditations, not sleep music, but sleep stories. That is what helps me the most. I've emailed them twice to request more stories. The response has been that stories are added every week. But this is not true. It rotates between additions of sleep music, meditations and stories. So in truth, about one to two a month are added. 
If you have as big a problem as I do sleeping then the repitition of the same stories over and over becomes less effective. 
I've looked everywhere else for more stories but Calm is still the best for stories. I just wish they focused as much on the stories as they do on meditation. 

I have serious trouble sleeping, and the Calm sleep stories are a big help for me. I can listen to them and focus on the reader and my mind won't wander off like it always does to a million other things. Before I know it I'm asleep😊"
139,2019-11-23 07:43:29,2,"There is so much advertised about this app that’s “free,” but turns out this “free” stuff, the majority of it costs money.  I believe that the CEO(s) should provide a few more free sessions/for the clients to use and enjoy because it is quite frustrating not being able to listen to a variety of stories or ANY SONGS without receiving a fee.  This app is supposed to improve mental health, but look at me now, not being able to sleep because all that I CAN listen to is the saaaaame thing over and over until I am just strait up angry.  Please try to adopt a few of these suggestions and look through what I’ve stated.  I feel this app can be so much more than the flourishing app that it is now.  What I’m trying to say is this is a great app and I loke it when I’m feeling down, but there is definitely room for improvement.
P.S. more variety for the breathing exercises would be highly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and I hope you put this information into good use."
140,2017-12-23 12:27:43,5,"I never write reviews, but I have to share my positive experience and how life changing this app is. I was having issues with sleeping, which I have never encountered before. I would be exhausted and fall asleep at 7pm and wake up at 330am, unable to fall back to sleep. I went to the doctor for blood tests to see if i had any other physical issues that may be triggering the change in my sleep pattern and all tests came back negative. My doctor recommended to practice better sleep hygiene. I started using this app in the morning to meditate (10 min) and then use the sleep induced relaxation before bed. For 2 weeks now I have been able to get a full night sleep and feel more calm during the day. It takes practice and a willing to change, but this is the tool to use if you are ready and willing and want more calm and sleep in your daily life!"
141,2021-01-25 03:44:01,5,"I get premium content through Kaiser insurance (which has been the best part of their mental health services, but that’s a different review....). 

I am so incredibly grateful for it because I’ve been using it for the past two months and it took me out a depressive episode. 

Jeff Warren’s content keeps me around. It’s because of his 30 day course that I’ve finally established a meditation practice after years of sincere attempts. His approach is very human and relatable; I find sessions with his recordings much more fruitful since he sandwiches the nuggets of clarity between quiet moments. I’m able to ease into the session, instead of being urged into quietness then being lectured by Tamara..maybe that works for other people but it’s inaccessible to me. 

I also use the children’s meditations with my five year old daughter and the sleep stories when she’s having a hard time sleeping. I’m glad to share this experience and skill with her. I was fortunate to have an elementary school teacher show me how powerful meditation and journaling was at an early age, but didn’t have a way to reintroduce it into my adult life AND share it with my daughter till now. 

I used Insight Timer for awhile but was overwhelmed by the features and endless options. I like that this is more curated and it’s lucky Jeff Warren’s content is so appealing to me."
142,2017-09-04 22:08:28,5,"I absolutely love, needed and highly recommend this app! Whether it's for small daily breathing exercises, soothing sounds for bedtime or meditation, this app helps guide you along a path of self recovery and starts the moment you click download. I have to say it has helped me with daily living. The bedtime stories and soothing sounds alone sold me but I love the daily calm meditations. I have been healing daily and recommend everyone try it. My daughter loves it to help her sleep and the guided meditation. She now is a very enlightened, leveled out ten year old and the meditation helps now with her hormonal and menstrual transition.  I have to say everyone can benefit highly from it. The free demo is great to get your feet started and see how it helps before if you feel some doubt, but I doubt you will have any after you try it! Your soul will thank you! Calm yourself and Calm your soul."
143,2019-09-09 12:24:34,5,"I have been using Calm for over a year now and although I have fallen off the wagon a few times, I always gravitate back. It’s so helpful and sincerely helps guide you to a better state, so peacefully! Tamara is amazing and so soothing. She is like this little angle on your shoulder telling you it’s ok to just be, to find acceptance in everything. 

I have always been hesitant to start a meditation practice. Seemed so yuppie! But it really isn’t, it’s so much more than just sitting in silence and chanting to yourself or needing to be like a monk! It’s a short moment to practice awareness/mindfulness and learn to be present. To help guide you back to what is important in life. In the busyness of our current world, this app is genuinely “the calm within the storm.” It teaches better emotional intelligence as well. Struggling with PTSD and seeing many therapists that had good intentions but never really helped, I knew I had to ignite the change from within. This app along with Gratitude 365 did just that for me! It works! 

The Master Classes are also a favorite of mine; I wish they would post more! But I adore listening to the podcast like lessons; so helpful! 

I can’t recommend this app enough! It is worth every penny and then some! Better than a copay for a therapist! Do yourself a favor and commit to it and I promise you won’t be disappointed!"
144,2020-01-23 12:28:02,3,"I used to rave about Calm to my family and friends a while back, telling them how helpful it was for insomnia, meditation and relaxing. My personal favorite sleep story is “The Waterfall”. (I still don’t know the ending because it always put me to sleep within 5 minutes!)

Another thing I loved about Calm was the number of features available for free. Although I couldn’t afford the annual fee, the free items were VERY helpful to me. Now, I’m greatly disappointed that most of those free features are now paid features, including “The Waterfall”. 

It would be great if Calm at least offered a monthly payment option. The subject of mindful meditation, mental health, etc. is no longer taboo and on the rise and people of all incomes need resources available to them. I don’t fault Calm for charging for most of their features, but with the app ranking at #1, they should make more features available for people who cannot afford to pay a fee."
145,2021-01-06 22:43:44,1,"I have been using this app to fall asleep when I need a reliable source of comforting white noise for a few years now. It’s not something that I use all the time but it’s something I come back to on those occasions when I can’t sleep. Recently, when I needed my song that helps me fall asleep every once in a while, I went into the app to find it LOCKED for the first time EVER. When I clicked on it to try and play the song, (water falling by Kip Mazuy in “nature melodies”) a pop up comes up talking about a 7 day free trial and then a monthly payment after that. Unacceptable. You can’t just take something that has been free for years and then all of a sudden make it into a paid service. I know it’s a small issue but I am livid about this. I literally cannot believe this. You have taken my only reliable song that puts me to sleep when melatonin won’t do the trick. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now when I can’t sleep and need to. You people behind the app probably don’t care though. Obviously all you care about is your GD money."
146,2019-05-31 03:00:29,5,"I downloaded this app a few weeks ago during a particularly stressful stretch at work, and I have done at least one meditation every day since.  After working my way through all of the free meditations (a huge variety based on your needs - anxiety, focus, self esteem, etc.), this had become a part of my daily routine, so I went for the subscription.  And WOW, it’s so much more than just meditation - the daily calm each morning, the sleep stories before bed (so cozy, and come on, who doesn’t want Matthew McConaughey to read you a bedtime story??), the guided stretches, the breathing...all of it is so well thought out and relaxing.  It helps so much with stress from life and work, and has really improved my overall quality of life.  Definitely recommend, especially for those with stressful jobs or anxiety looking to improve their wellbeing."
147,2019-01-16 06:28:13,5,"Wow! Just wow I have never written an app review but this app is amazing! If you like soothing things like candles and mood lighting you’ll love this!  I’ve had it for 6 days and I’ve used it for 6 days straight! ( the app likes to make you feel good about this and hey I love it!) I am not the type that can typically stick to something for more than a day or two but this app is something that makes you want to come back for more! The sleep stories are amazing and made me have vivid expressive dreams (of fields with lavender because of the lavender story of course!) The music portion is perfect for trying to focus in the office! And the guided meditation for beginners, is something I know will have transformative power over my life! There is a reason Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk meditate, it’s very effective! Overall download this app and pay full price for it, ya worth every penny!!"
148,2019-07-30 21:20:44,2,"When I first downloaded this app, I was so excited to try out mediating in a new way! But when I found out how many limits there were until you unlocked the premium version, I was quite disappointed. There are different categories like mediation, sleep, and music, but you can do only up to three or none of the options given inside each category. Even when you can do one of the mediation/sleep/etc. options, it only lets you do one “day” or “chapter”. At first I was fine with only a few options given, thinking I could do all the chapters of each selection, but they don’t let you unless you pay. I do get why they would need the money from putting so much effort into this beautiful app, but they have to at least make it somewhat enjoyable without having to pay for basically everything that is offered. So unless I’m able to complete all the days in each option inside the categories, I think the app would be pretty decent."
149,2020-10-06 15:16:08,5,"I do love my Calm.  I don’t go to sleep without it.  I also use it when I take a nap.
But I would like to suggest when new ones are done that you leave out the word “bed”.  There are many of us that sleep in a chair/recliner.  I haven’t slept in a bed in over 10 years and can’t because of arthritis in my spine.  I’ve mentioned this to people and found so many people can’t sleep in bed for various reasons.  Many of your stories don’t use the word bed but still say things like snuggle under the covers and that works.
I don’t mean to be negative because I love your stories and I have my favorites and my favorite people to read them.  They are a blessing for those who have trouble sleeping like me.  Any time I wake in the night I put one on to help me back to sleep and it works.  It’s truly wonderful except for the word bed.
Thank you so much."
150,2019-01-07 14:02:40,3,"I get really bad anxiety and a friend told me to try out this app. So I downloaded it and by the looks of it, it looked pretty good. So I left it at that and didn’t dig deeper til I needed it. A few days later I was going on a trip to Colorado with my swim team. We were away from home and I got really anxious. I decided to hop onto this app. I opened thinking about the vast choices I get to “calm” me down, but then was struck by everything being locked. I didn’t know I had to pay to be at peace with myself. I do prioritize my mental health, but having to pay $70 a year for it is kinda of ridiculous, especially for someone who works seasonal. There was an anxiety one that my friend said was good for this situation. But of course it was locked. Now Ik why people are still stressed, cause they have to pay to be calm. Instead of getting upset right away, I clicked on an unlocked one and let it play. What are you supposed to do when you finish the unlocked ones??"
151,2020-06-09 05:13:40,5,"I’ve NEVER written a review for an app, but this app seriously has changed my life. I use to have such bad anxiety that I lost all my self confidence, my ability to remain calm in the face of stress, and it began even affecting me physically. I began using Calm (alongside other mental health resources) and it has taught me so much.

       They have SO many selections; sleep stories, mediations for multiple scenarios, meditation to understand emotions, music, and the best one is that they do a new 10 minute meditation every day with a awesome little life lesson/lesson on mindfulness at the end. They're also so good about talking you through meditation, how to do it, to understand it’s ok to mess up. Its so comforting, I listen every night before bed or when im anxious, it helps SO much. My mentality, emotions, and reactions to stressors has changed SO much since using it. I REALLY recommend it!"
152,2019-10-10 15:04:05,5,"Ok, many flaws and hard to navigate and very poor support. By the time one spends trying to figure out what’s going on, how to retrieve some part of program, you have spent tooooo much time on your device. This is suppose to be ? Calming.

Have received help on the glitches and now working well. I do like this app and it does help center oneself, calm oneself and with mindfulness accept one’s daily life with understanding. Continuing to work with this program. Thanks

I love the Calm App. Wished I had started mindfulness meditation years ago but happy I found it now. There are so many areas of this app that have helped me attain, I guess a better understanding of who I am and a loving kindness towards myself and others. It is not easy and many times difficult but this app has helped in my daily life, my attitude and judgements toward self and others. I thank you."
153,2018-10-24 06:09:17,5,"I was first exposed to meditation at 17 when I started doing yoga ... My first teacher, who I loved, would have us meditate for about 5-7 minutes at the end of class, telling us to “let our thoughts wash over us like water”. The yoga stuck, the meditation didn’t ... But at 31, battling depression, anxiety and perfectionism as so many of us do, I was ready to seek a solution from within. Thank God for CALM. It surprised me with a new drive to meditate everyday, sometimes even twice. There is a session for whatever you are feeling, whether you’re in tears, in a panic or feeling enlightened and like all is right with the world. Tamara and John constantly remind you to be gentle, kind and patient with yourself, and honestly, who doesn’t need to hear that? I am so so happy to be meditating and have Calm as a force for self care in my life. Try it out and subscribe stat!"
154,2018-09-03 01:24:39,5,"As soon as I experienced the mind - body connection 
These short guided meditations create , I became addicted!
Now I have to have my meditation time upon awakening in the AM with Tamara’s “Daily Calm” and in the evening with “Deep Sleep Release”.  In between or when I just want more of what is offered , I go for it and am rarely disappointed.  Tamara is so present it is like having your own personal “mindfulness” Trainer right beside you with full attention on your betterment. I have practiced qigong for years and this is a wonderful quick pick me up selection of meditations when I’m too lazy to do a more physical meditation.  PLUS,  Tamara really helps you understand why you focus on the breath more than I have learned from others. I also love her tasteful selection of quotes and allegories to take into my day. 

  I’m a creative person and I think Tamara particularly understands the energy of creative people and resonates with that energy more than other guided meditation facilitators I have tried. 
  Thank you so much Tamara for having created a meaningful, healing  app to help us all be more mindful and connected to ourselves in a world that is filled with distractions constantly pulling us away from our ability to be centered and connected and mindful throughout the day."
155,2020-10-12 13:16:39,5,"This year has been a crazy one for everyone. My anxiety and stress had been on an all time high, so when I got the notification from American Express that we could try the app for free I thought, what do I have to lose? 

Meditation has now become my go to, I’ve made it the central part of my morning routine with the 10 min “Daily Calm” meditation to begin my day. Throughout the day, if I feel myself beginning to get tense and stressed, I know it’s my queue to go ground myself again with the app. The guidance is excellent for beginners, like myself, and really helps you zone in. 

This app has made me more mindful, it allows me to slow down and ground myself before I react. Overall I would recommend instilling a daily meditation practice to anyone. You truly do feel the difference, just be patient and give yourself grace, but stick to it!"
156,2019-07-28 02:23:14,5,"I’m not one for writing reviews, this is my first because I always think to myself if an app does its job then it’ll speak for itself. However, Calm does it job and more. I have trouble sleeping on various occasions, particularly when I’m sick, being sick gives me a strange anxiety causing me to stay up later and later. I tried the free version starting off with the “Sleep Stories” (Blue Gold to be exact) hoping that it would help reduce my anxiety and get me to sleep peacefully. It’s done exactly that, I’ve used it for the past 4 nights and upgraded to premium in order to listen to more stories as I Calmly get whisked away to a better nights sleep. 

I can only imagine what the other functions of the app do and how they may help, but I’m more than pleased and genuinely looking forward to exploring the rest of the app. Thank you !"
157,2019-11-14 12:20:23,2,"This app seems like it WOULD be cool.  Of course, it would only make sense to have ALL the features unlocked for the 7 day trial period before charging $80 for a year subscription.  I mean, let’s be real.  How can you guys charge that much for something that is predominantly locked throughout the app?  Very disappointing, and frankly, I feel like I’m getting hustled.  Everyone knows you let the consumer try it first with all the premium features before charging a whopping $80! Honestly, this app should be free with “in-app” purchases.  Is it only for people that have $80 to gamble that most likely have million dollar estates or are the ones riding their Peleton bike overlooking the city lights in their high-rise condos?  Jk Do not get me wrong.  I am looking for the benefits from this app which I am sure it can provide because I see all the great features I love.  Unfortunately, all those features are locked which is dumb.  Please fix this because I’m sure u guys deserve a 5 star but I guess I will never know."
158,2018-01-16 04:57:43,5,"I downloaded this app as the free version and didn’t really do much on it, but one day I kinda jumped into it and thought that it was kinda cool. So I bought the monthly subscription and life’s kinda gotten in the way and I sort of forgot about it. Well today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day and today was the first day I listened to a daily calm. It was about contribution and how you can be inspired. She talked about how you contribute without even noticing it such as helping a friend through a hard time. Well, it just so happens that I helped a friend through a rough night tonight and I just kind of felt like it really spoke to me and i felt touched. I am looking forward to doing this everyday from here on out and I cannot wait to see what daily calms are headed my way. Thank you guys for creating such a peaceful, uplifting, and thoughtful app. (Sorry this is so long lol)"
159,2017-11-10 01:41:30,5,I have never written an app review before but I had to for Calm because I am so in love with this app. Not only is Calm super user friendly but I love every single thing this app has to offer. I love the daily meditations and how you can favorite any session you do so you can go back and do it again. I also love how it tracks everything for you. Most importantly though is how much this app has truly changed my life. I have bettered myself in all aspects of my life from focus in school to finding peace in a very fast paced stressful job. Anxiety has always been a major issue for me (and trust me I have tried many other methods of managing stress from therapy to medications etc) but nothing has done half as much for me as meditating regularly with this app. I really hope this app never changes because I love it so much and it is worth every penny!!
160,2021-02-01 23:29:19,5,"I love the Calm app!  I recommend getting the premium content.  Calm is a tool for dealing with the challenges of life.  There is more awareness on anxiety, depression, and negative feelings.  I am hopeful for the future because this will improve people’s lives.  I gifted the app to my friends and family who also enjoy it - beautiful, inspirational meditations, music, masterclasses, teachings, body exercises, sleep stories and music and so much more!  I wish my family and I had Calm for difficult times in our lives.  I am comforted knowing we have Calm now for difficult times in the future.  I am excited to see the upcoming new content which is frequently updated and improved.  Thank you to everyone at Calm - you all inspire and help me!  You changed and improved life for my family, friends, and me!  And for many other people in the world!"
161,2018-12-08 18:37:16,5,"This app is absolutely amazing, nothing with this app is annoying, for me it’s great to have the German language too. 
I love the background music with different themes, and the fact that you can set up a timer for that. I leave the night mode playing for 2 hours before sleeping and it’s such a nice sleep. I wish the App Developers read my comment and add another feature to this fantastic app: PLEASE PLEASE think about an alarm clock, or maybe another option to add different times with different background music too. In this case users can have different background music during the day/night. 
I lOVE to wake up with the background music mornings. I always wake up earlier in the morning to set a sound for couple of hours and then sleep again with it, it’s such a fantastic sleep and I have more energy in the morning."
162,2020-11-02 06:49:16,2,"Dear developers of Calm,

The app of pretty good and very useful but everything is so limited. There are many people who are still in school and cannot afford premium, students like me and others who are much younger. Your 7 day trial of meditation only had one available day and honestly I don’t want to listen to the same thing over and over again. I understand premium is a way to make a money but c’mon now, it’s ridiculous that we have to pay for something that could potentially help our mental health. I’d honestly rather sit through an ad through all the days of the 7 day trial or something. Not only would it be more available for other people to use, but you still get payed from the ad plus the additional pay from people using premium. There is literally no music I can play, barely any stories I can listen to, barely any meditation practices, and there’s only one breathing exercise. Please, be more reasonable with this. It’s absolutely ridiculous."
163,2020-07-10 07:57:47,2,"I love what you’ve done here, everything you guys had on the unlocked free stuff is amazing until you took that away from me. I used this app for years Before you locked every single thing i use in the sounds and music (thats the only thing i use). Before they were locked off, this app was helping me with panic and anxiety attacks during the day and helping me sleep at night. I was perfectly fine using this free and now when i scroll through the sounds to find something that’ll help me again, no joke every singe thing was locked and I actually had the worst mental breakdown in a long time. This was the only app that ever actually helped me, ive gone through so many apps and websites until I found Calm. Now once again i dont have anything to help me and im having panic attacks without anything for relief
I dont want to pay the $60 whatever dollars a year because im so. Flipping. Broke. And so i think ima just give up and suffer through the pain now"
164,2020-12-04 15:43:05,5,"I’ve had the Premium version of this app for only a week now, but I have been loving the wide selection of meditations (and meditation series!) that are available. I’ve found that because I’ve invested in the subscription, it’s been a bigger motivation for me to be consistent with a daily meditation routine (the series options have also motivated me to keep going). The background scene and it’s accompanying calming noises also adds an element of relaxation to the experience, which I very much enjoy. I haven’t tried the sleep stories yet, but my partner and his family love them. The only thing I would like to see changed is allowing us the ability to select more than one emotion for the check-ins and I’d also appreciate a larger emotion selection. However, this app is wonderful and I highly recommend it."
165,2019-08-16 11:59:26,5,"I have used the Calm app for three or four years now and recommend it to all my friends. More information is constantly being added. The bedtime stories, which I listen to nearly every night, have such a wide variety to choose from. My 9 year-old granddaughter does the same choosing her stories from the kids section. Both she and I also use the app to meditate. They have a special kid section for that as well and they offer everything from body scans to categories where they give lots of instructions and directions and also categories where they speak very little. It also has visuals to help you breathe deeply. I know this is a subscription app and we all want things that are free, but remember usually you get what you pay for and that is certainly true in this case."
166,2019-11-22 23:48:10,2,"I just unsubscribed from my yearly subscription because the constant and unavoidable in app notifications were intrusive and the opposite of calming. They include banners that cannot be dismissed without actually listening to new “celebrity” meditations or sleep stories I have zero interest in and green notification badges on the music and stories tabs that alert you every time there is something new. This should be optional. These sorts of notifications are stressful, Fuel tech addiction and a constant feeling of a need to be doing something rather than just be, and are basically fueling the exact fire the app is supposed to help put out. It got to the point that I couldn’t stand to open the app. I have no interest in paying $100 a year for more unavoidable notifications. I hope the developers take this feedback into account. The ridiculous amount of stress they place on celebrity over quality of content is also off putting."
167,2021-02-22 00:37:55,5,"I started with the free version, which admittedly is kind of a joke - there is very little content to digest without paying. That being said, the full version is WORTH the money. This is my 2nd yearly subscription and I plan on renewing as long as this app exists (which I honestly hope is forever). Calm changed my life and my entire relationship with spirituality. Practicing daily guided mediations from Calm has helped me with regulating my emotions, anxieties, and energy levels more than anything I’ve ever tried. I can’t speak highly enough of the value and lessons to be learned from the guided sessions (the daily calm is my fav!), daily check-ins, and even in-app gratefulness and reflection journals. I recommend to anyone and everyone. If you have an open mind and open heart, and you want to strengthen them... you won’t regret it."
168,2019-01-26 06:05:05,2,"I love the idea of this app, even after downloading and discovering what is available to you. BUT! The options I have are very very limited if I don’t pay for the premium Calm experience. Just like every other app, I am fully aware you can’t get the best of it without paying for a premium version, but with this app, your options are SO limited that you barely even have options if you don’t pay for premium. I can only listen to 1 story if I don’t pay for the premium version, and every other category options are just the same amount of limited. I was going to give this 3 stars for the regular version and not the premium version, but after further exploration on the app, I found myself even more disappointed with how many options I DONT have because I didn’t pay for premium. Other apps will let you explore more even without the premium version, but this one does not do that. Thanks for taking the time to read my review."
169,2018-11-12 04:38:05,3,"I would rate this app a 3/3.5 because I was very disappointed how it said it was “free” but you literally almost have to pay to do anything on it. For the free users, I do not recommend this because the lack of variety. If you are purchasing the app it would be a much better experience. I had a difficult time using the app because it was a little hard to navigate because of all the different things that was offered (for the purchasers only). This app did not do much to my sleep. It helps me fall asleep faster because I was focused on the meditation. I got my normal sleep and there was not a massive difference. The appearance of the app was very pleasant at first then it got overwhelming to look at because of all the options it gave the purchasers. Overall, I would not recommend this app if you do not a plan on purchasing the full membership of it that includes all of its best features."
170,2018-01-03 17:31:18,4,"I’ve stuck with this meditation app for a month now which is longer than any other app I’ve tried. There’s so many options and I love the snippets of teaching within the sessions that give you something to think about throughout the day. My only critique is that I wish there was a packet or more sessions or even more examples within the sessions given that focus on dealing with chronic/persistent illness. Many of the examples I just don’t relate to. (Break ups, job loss, etc). I think this would even be a good advertisement opportunity considering the vast population of chronically ill people. There’s a nuance to this type of illness that desperately needs attention. That is, it’s chronic. It doesn’t go away. It doesn’t even change in some circumstances. It’s a constant trigger. Would love to hear some of the experts at Calm speak to this particular issue. Thank you for considering!"
171,2019-07-08 00:49:45,5,"This is a fantastic app. It costs a lot for an app, and I expected to quit after the free trial. But it was too good and useful. There are lots of different guided mindfulness meditations, which I’ve actually been using regularly. It’s really helped me work short meditation practices into my day at different times (and for different purposes: from focus to calm to sleep). I’ve also listened to some of the sleep music and sleep stories to help wind-down and get a good nights sleep when I’m hyped up over a stressful day.

Request: One thing I’m really hoping they will add soon is a separate set of guided meditations (or at least one longer one) for actual mind-body physical healing (after injury, surgery, or from illness). I would also benefit from guided meditations on coping with & living with chronic pain. Please consider adding these!"
172,2021-01-06 05:19:49,3,"I like the app and have had it for a week so far and the layout is easy to navigate. The only downside is that you can’t put anything in your queue to play. For instance if you do a 15 minute mediation and want sleep sounds to play during the night, you have to go back in your phone after meditation to choose the sleep sound and manually start it. It seems counter productive to me to have to go back into your phone after a sleep meditation to play sleep sounds. If this app would allow users to put things in a queue to play more than one meditation without having to break the practice or to play a sleep sound after meditation without breaking practice by allowing users to use a queue, it would be perfect. Especially since we’re paying so much for this app and it’s not necessarily cheap. Otherwise has
great features and numerous different options for a tranquil experience"
173,2020-01-09 10:59:32,1,"When introduced to the calm app it was the best thing regardless of whether you paid for it or not, there were still plenty of programs that you were able to listen to. Found it so useful for me that I began to recommend it for my patients even those that could not afford the subscription it allowed them to have access to some of the programs that were useful for them. However, this is no longer the case which I found out when it asked me to review my subscription & before doing it decided to checkout what was available, which truly disappointed me. If you don't pay you’ll have access to a very limited programs. I understand the app needs to make money but, as with many things that gain popularity, it shifted from helping others to now make money. 

Despite this app being amazing which I used almost daily, I will not renew the subscription & seek another app that I can use, that I can also recommend for my patients who experience financial difficulties. 

Thank you."
174,2019-04-21 21:06:05,5,"I use it daily now, though I did not at first.  At first I got it to start the practice of meditating but like most habits I want to establish, I quickly lost my stride and pretty much gave up. But because I often listened to the bedtime stories and used its ""Scenes"" for white noise to get work done, the app stayed on my radar and kept encouraging me. Eventually I tried the meditation part again, permitting myself to do it while lying down, right before falling asleep, (not the 'right' way). This training wheels method worked for me. Now I do the Daily Calm every morning and another meditation before bed (both sitting upright in a relaxed but alert position). Best of all, when I sense my stress levels rise during the day, I can focus on the breath and return a bit easier to a sense of calm. Much thanks to Tamara Levitt and all at Calm. 🙏"
175,2019-02-21 20:01:23,5,"In a little over a year I have found that ever so gradually I am facing fears, memories and addictions which I didn’t have the courage to explore. I need to face, explore and find a new path for myself within. It’s not an easy thing to look and feel within, to face my role in the stories that seem to control me. But day by day I am, and sometimes I can even let things go! Not all the time, but often enough that I am encouraged. The sleep stories are also remarkable. I usually fall asleep before they are over and some I return to over and over for the voices and the stories themselves. Such blessing for an insomniac! 
You are the best therapy for anyone seeking a place of refuge in a world of constant noise and anger. Thank you, Tamara, and all the writers and readers who “calm” my days and nights. I have a long way to go. And you are great companions."
176,2021-01-20 12:26:17,3,"I have been a paid subscriber for years, and, until this year, I would have said that this app is perfect for insomnia: 

Celebrity voices coupled with the technique of measured cadence and gradually diminishing volume are features that make this sleep aide unique and more effective than any of the many others that I’ve tried.

I only wish there were a timer on the nature noise that comes in when the sleep story is finished,  as it is the ABSENCE of noise that eventually wakes me up in the morning, like the opposite of an alarm. I use silence as my alarm on another app and it works splendidly, and is not nerve wracking, like an alarm would be.

However, after years of satisfaction, an noticeable issue has come to my attention: More and more of the sleep stories are of a religious nature. At first the sleep stories were fantastic: funny stories, fairie tales, travelogues, poetry, even some to BORE you to sleep, like someone reading the rules of cricket! LOL 

But, for some reason, writings are containing more and more religious content and I’m starting to feel like I’m in a class on Religions of the World, when I’m trying to go to sleep. This falls into the category of “persuasive rhetoric “ and my brain is busy analyzing my own opinion s on the theology or philosophy that is presented, keeping me from resting. 

Could we please just have stories that our brains will not be analyzing for truth?"
177,2017-09-15 00:14:20,5,"I'm new to meditation.  I've tried several apps, online sources, etc, and always come back to this app. The narrator's voice is absolutely perfect for this. She's very soothing, clear, and her voice just works for this.  There is just enough instruction to help bring me back on focus.  I also love the various background sounds you can choose from which provides me with a consistency from each session I choose which has helped me get in the swing of things.  I was really hesitant to pay for something like this, but it's been three months and I have no plans on canceling.  Additionally, I did have a problem which turned out to be my fault. I contacted customer service when I was trying to figure out the problem.  They were quick to respond and provided great instructions.  Highly recommend this app."
178,2021-02-01 10:56:59,5,"This app is just unbelievable. I am a mom of two, ages 16 & 6, and I am also a special ed teacher, and I use this app both at home snd with my students!! Both of my kids have sensory issues as well as OCD, ADHD, and severe anxiety. My daughter’s needs are more severe than my sons are, and over this past year, there were some nights where this app was the only thing that got my daughter to sleep. She particularly loves the Disney lullabies and the Matthew 
mcconaughey sleep story... can you blame her?! 🤣🙃😉 haha JK...  but seriously, they are so relaxing ... I even enjoy the sleep stories!!

I was fortunate enough to receive a subscription for free when Calm was doing the give away for teachers years ago; however, even if I hadn’t gotten it for free, I would pay for it in a heartbeat!! One of the best apps we own, even if we don’t always use it!!"
179,2020-08-23 19:38:48,5,"I was very skeptical about meditation before I actually started meditating. After trying everything I possibly could including exercising three hours straight like a maniac after work to try to manage my stress, I was recommended this app for guided meditation. I thought, why not give it a try? I am very grateful I did because meditation has been life changing in the way I view myself and the world. I’ve managed my stress much better and I now handle difficult situations in a more calm and coherent manner. It helped me grow and adapt as a person. There are so many great features within this app that I also love like breathing exercises and stories from successful people on their journey.  Whether you are struggling or not, I think this app would be beneficial and helpful in your life and I highly recommend it."
180,2020-07-01 06:34:02,5,"I love this app and have been using it since 2016. I feel like I know Tamara haha! My only complaint is that the new home screen is way too cluttered. It seems like a small thing, but visually it’s not very calming. I liked it better when the home screen just showed the Daily Calm and you could find other meditations on a different button. There should be a section for “New Meditations” so we can see the updates and new additions, but it’s my strong personal opinion that the home page now looks way too hectic for a meditation app. It’s bugged me enough for the past few months that I finally wrote a review. But I recommend this app to everyone, I absolutely can’t say enough good things about the meditations/backgrounds/music- keep doing awesome things, and please simplify home screen!"
181,2020-08-10 03:02:22,5,"Hello, I’m Jessica mother of Amy (age 5) and Molly (age 3) now tonight my children decided they wanted to listen to Snow White but when we searched we didn’t see anything so we made a list of tales you should add! First off, Princess and The Frog, my children love this tale and before calm I read it to them almost every night. Second, Goldie Locks, I remember picking Amy up from Pre-K and her telling me all about this story, she was very happy when I bought the book and read it to her and wants it on calm too! Third, Hansel and Gretel, this sweet book made Molly drool about a candy house, so I knew it must be added to calm which hopefully will! Lastly, The Three Billy Goats Gruff, this Story I told Molly when she wasn’t even two, but I knew she liked it because as I read she giggled happily in her crib. Anyways hopefully you see this. Stay Safe Stay Home.
          -Jessica"
182,2018-12-04 18:49:26,3,"I’ve been trying to deal with my anxiety and find ways to calm my mind, and my Apple Health app recommended Calm.  The layout is pretty user friendly and I adore the nature sounds. My major complaint is that the majority of the content is locked by the paywall of Calm Premium. They only have one day locked for a couple of sessions, which makes little sense to me.  I wish that they had a couple of full sessions and stories up for free as a better way to get people to subscribe.  Speaking of that, I also wish they had a monthly subscription.  Not everyone can shell out $70 at any time.  Despite these drawbacks, I’m still making use of the app. The Breathe feature allows me to select a scene and just breathe and focus on myself for a few minutes.  I’m sure the other features are great, but I have no way of knowing because I can’t afford that annual fee.  Add a monthly fee and I’ll be a happy lady!"
183,2020-03-29 18:14:31,5,"I’ve had the free trial for 2 days now, and as a person who has clinically suffered from anxiety and depression most of my life, I already feel so grounded and balanced. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis & being in the epicenter of it all, I’ve never experienced as much physical and mental relief as I have these past couple of days, simply by listening to the guided meditations, playing the soothing nature sounds while I quickly grocery shop, or falling asleep to the stories.  I would LOVE and HOPE to see more options available to us. I turn to this app any time I feel the need for balance and restoration of inner peace, and believe many of us can benefit from what is has to offer, especially right now. Thank you Calm for restoring my calm 🙏🏽 I hope to see some efforts from your successful company to help make this more widely available."
184,2019-09-30 07:55:08,5,"i’ve been using calm for about over a year now. I started using it back when i went to therapy. During that time period i was really struggling with sleep and had a really rough time trying to figure out how to fix it, then my therapist suggested this app for me and ever since it has truly turned around my sleep schedule. i use it EVERY SINGLE NIGHT to go to sleep. I listen to the same sound every night (rain sounds), and it’s just so helpful! I’ve struggled with night terrors and rough sleeping my entire life, and have also been taking melatonin since i was about 5 (14 now), and melatonin truly helped until i reached an older age where it just wouldn’t help me sleep anymore. So since i’ve had this app, things have truly been amazing for me! thank you so much and i TRULY TRULY reccomend! :)"
185,2019-09-08 19:34:21,5,"Calm has officially become my favorite app. I never thought I could meditate and develop mindfulness...Calm thankfully proved me wrong.  It has helped me sleep, reduce my anxiety, improve my depression, and reduce impulsive/reactive behavior.  In short, Calm has helped me a calmer person. I’m excited to see where this journey will go.  If you are in CBT (and definitely if you are in DBT), this will greatly help you overcome negative thought patterns.

For beginners, do the 7 days of calm.  Then do the 21 days of calm.  If you need, repeat the 21 days of calm. This will train you with the ability of basic meditation.  If you commit to improving your mental and spiritual health.  

Final advice, don’t buy the app right away.  If you wait, you will get an email for 40% off an annual membership.  Then, take advantage of that membership and commit to changing your life."
186,2018-06-23 01:07:36,5,"From the get go, I love that it doesn't make you create an account to use it. There are lots of nice nature sounds available with visuals for free and I really appreciate that they will keep playing when I use another app or lock my phone (a setting you can turn off). I also like that the nature sounds starts playing upon opening, the ease of swiping to different sounds, and that I pick what sounds pop up on my screen. I have just been using that feature for a while and have just decided to give their guided meditations a shot. It doesn't seem like they have as many free guided meditations as Simple Habit, but they seem to cover the topics I want, and I'm partial to simple nature sounds anyway. Even when I don't want to meditate it makes wonderful background noise. Really appreciate it."
187,2017-08-29 11:38:16,5,"This app saved me.  I've been in and out of work for the past few months due to what turned out to be massive panic attacks.  Doctors recommended medication but I chose meditation instead.  3 weeks in and I have been able to control these attacks thus far.  I will update my review in a year's time.  I really love this app.  The guidance is soothing and informative.  Who knew an almost 40 year old blue collar guy could benefit from such practices?!  By the way, I use it while walking, before bed, and after breakfast while the house is still quiet.  I have also been eating better and spending time in the kitchen cooking to keep my mind busy on more important things.  This app has taught me to control my thoughts.  I wish it was around when I was in my 20's!  My life would have been much improved.  Try it.  Buy it!"
188,2020-11-28 10:22:58,5,"I have been using this app a little ver two years, and I love it! I use it for nights when I can’t fall asleep. I mean, who doesn’t have good memories of story time at night , being read a story by mom or dad, and falling asleep while they were reading?!💕
Also if I wake up to use the restroom, and can’t fall back to sleep I use it again!  Al l 
Stories have a time on them, and iPhone shuts off when story is over. I also use the music app to! More recently, I have tried the soundscapes. My favorite is the light rain at night. You can even hear a few crickets and night creatures, very relaxing.
I live in the city, and two doors down from me, they are building a home. I discovered that by put this soundscape on high volume, it blocks out the noises of the cat, and the hammering.   I just love this app!"
189,2019-11-11 11:14:24,5,"I tried Calm because my therapist thinks I can benefit from meditation.  I was skeptical since I tried some meditation tapes and they made my anxiety worse!  I put on one of their meditation and I felt so much more calm and relaxed afterwards, their stories help me fall asleep on nights when I just couldn’t settle down and they even have music and meditation for every mood.  I even played the baby shh (one of the sounds they have on there) for my fussy 2 month old niece when she, my brother and sister-in-law came to visit and she settled down and fell asleep quickly!  I am glad they have the option to pay for a yearly subscription as there is no way I can pay monthly.  I highly recommend this app for those who suffer from anxiety, depression and any type of mental illness.  This really does work!"
190,2017-12-10 16:32:49,5,"I have a high-stress job, and at an employee wellness seminar, they suggested mindful meditation. Then I saw an ad for this app on Facebook. So I thought, “Why not?”
This app is wonderful. There are sessions for beginners that are a great introduction to the practice. I used the app for two weeks before deciding to upgrade. It’s 100% worth the steep price. You can choose from a wide variety of background music or nature sounds to play during your session, or choose silence. The sessions run from fully guided to no guide. You can set a timer. You can just do breathing exercises. As someone with anxiety and depression, I absolutely love the courses on gratitude and self-worth. I have definitely noticed a difference in my ability to handle stress and calm myself in hectic moments. I have recommended this app to all my friends and coworkers."
191,2018-09-25 04:16:20,5,"I've had to medicate myself to get to sleep for a very long time. I tried this app and loved the stories. I decided to splurge on the premium features (I rarely spend money on apps) and see how it went. That was a year ago and I just renewed my subscription. I plan on making better use of the meditation portions this year. The sleep stories are wonderful though and I would happily pay for this app for just that! Lots of different story readers to choose from so you know you'll find a voice that relaxes you. I can now sleep without sleeping aids! It's wonderful! Thank you!!!

Edit : I would love a section to track my mood and basically use as a journal. It would be really interesting to see the correlation between days where I meditate and days I don't and how it affects my mood."
192,2020-06-22 15:36:01,1,Why u ask? WellEverything is locked and so you can’t get to any of the good music he can’t do any fun stuff so you get a week free day trial but the. It’s 69 dollars a year! I am not poor but just it i just can’t really do it I mean I feel like everything should be free except for like the really good songs maybe but it’s very bright like all of them are locked so it’s no relaxing very much because it’s really boring so do you not get this app you’re just wasting your time and you might want to delete it later so I got this app so I could fall asleep better but I can’t fall asleep with all the things off and so they really got to chill and unlock some things it’s just so dumb so if someone’s reading this please unlock some stuff OK because this is on believable so all the rooms were good but to me it wasn’t that good it was really boring and really dumb and so I Hope song read this and knock some things because it’s not that cool if everything is locked and I won’t have you meditate like Fosse and so yeah bye
193,2018-03-30 20:06:31,5,"I really love this app. I am a combat veteran who suffers from chronic depression and meditating has really helped me deal with my anger, anxiety and depression. This app has been a big party of my recovery process however, twice now I have been in the middle of a session and the app has locked on me saying I need to upgrade to their yearly subscription. 

This has not been a suggestion the app would not let me access my current meditation sessions and unfortunately in both occasions it has happened when I was at very desperate moment. 

I think it is extremely unprofessional for this service to lock me out of my account when I paying for a service only because you want me to upgrade. In fact I’m positive it’s an infringement of a our contract. I will be contacting the app company to further inquire."
194,2020-04-24 11:44:18,5,"I’m someone who suffers from immense anxiety, insomnia, and just an overall lack of being able to relax. I downloaded the calm app one night when I couldn’t sleep, yet again, and I turned on one of the sleep stories and was asleep in minutes. Not only that but I stayed asleep the whole night! I woke up in the morning refreshed and so I thought I would try one of the daily meditations. After my first daily meditation, I understood why people make this regular practice. I love that this app keeps me on track and reminds me to check in with myself, complete my meditations, and also has an abundance of sleep stories to chose from. In doing my check-ins, I can actually see how in one week I have gone from overall very anxious, worried, and stressed to calm, happy, and grateful."
195,2018-11-30 15:09:41,5,"Still my favorite meditation app but I have an iPhone and had many downloaded on my phone. Have always paid for the app after realizing how well it worked. Well now it won’t let me keep the downloaded daily meditations I loved. Before you could download them to the iPhone. Now it doesn’t which sticks cause spending a lot of time in areas without service (you know nature lol) I’m not able to access all my favorite daily meditations which before I was able to access and have it downloaded. Please change this back so I and others can access these daily meditations offline and I can switch back to a 5 star review. This was a huge selling point for me and truly unfortunate it has been switched. 
Still a great meditation app and can still download the programmed meditations."
196,2018-05-05 06:11:18,5,"I’ve been using this app now for three years. It was great till about two updates ago where after the sleep meditation then all background sounds of the “mountain lake” stop when the meditation ended. They said, tech support, I could download the mountain lake and adjust the settings. Well there is no option for that for the “mountain lake” background sounds. I’ve told them now once a week since this changed. And still no movement on getting this option for the “mountain lake” background to be set to continuously play throughout the night.

Apparently my money I have subscribed to them over the three years and suggesting there app to other people means nothing to them. 

Maybe this review will get a better response."
197,2019-01-14 17:44:22,5,"Calm was my first introduction to meditation, and I’m still using it one year later. Thank you! Really good guidance for beginners and those growing their practices. A wide variety of themes makes it easy to customize my practice. 

The app is continually improving with new content, more organization, and bug fixes. 

ONE big request: on the Streak stat page, consider highlighting he current streak instead of the overall longest streak. Or hide the longest streak in a menu option that people can look up if they want. The purpose is to stay present feel accomplishment in any current streak, even if it’s small—and not be tempted to compare it to my longest past streak and feel bad. It’s still nice to know the longest, but would prefer on a voluntary basis"
198,2019-04-18 08:08:09,3,"I’ve been using this app every night for a week now and I will say that when it comes to the story section, majority of the people they have reading those stories don’t really have a soothing, soft voice to help put you to sleep and I’ve seen others complain about that feature also so hopefully they can make some changes. I love the nature sounds like rain and campfire especially since I can set a timer and they will continue to play even when I exit the app! Another thing I love is the lullaby section but I’m so disappointed that there’s only 4 to choose from and the only one that puts me to bed/makes me tired is lullaby to the stars. PLEASE add more lullabies that are softer and mellow like lullaby to the stars but please more lullabies would be amazing!!! Overall the app is good but considering I paid for the premium I just wish there were more sounds to choose from"
199,2017-08-30 13:07:20,5,"When I was looking for a good meditation app last year, I tried out maybe 4-5 of the most popular ones in the app store and found that Calm had the most pleasing audio narrations and visual design out of all of them and was also the most usable. And it works!  Over the course of the past 13 months, Calm has helped me go from just a handful of 10-minute sessions per month initially, to now meditating for 30-45 min each morning for 28 out of the past 30 days. (My only complaint is I hate these prompts for app store reviews, especially at the end of a session! Hopefully they go away now that I've left one?)

Also, as a suggestion, I'd love to see some basic data visualization to track my progress, eg, # of sessions per month or total time per month, graphed over time."
200,2017-08-30 13:53:00,5,"I love this app for so many reasons. I love the appearance of the app, I love the different backgrounds and music that you can choose. I love that you can choose meditations based on how you are feeling and what you need at the moment. I love how the calendar keeps track of your meditation practice and it's especially nice that it will let you know when you're on a multi day streak (that makes me even more likely to meditate as it's like a reward to see that pop up after a meditation). I love how after any meditation the daily quote pops up. I love the mindfulness reminder that I've set to keep me on track. I love the woman's voice on the meditations (and I can be very sensitive and picky about voices). I love that there are night stories and many to choose from. This is a great app, I highly recommend it."
201,2020-12-30 09:59:28,4,"I want to say I tried this app back in 2015 or 2016. I took a break from it for a while after I found Insight Timer because I much preferred the content on that app (comes from thousands of creators and is free). I’m not sure if I’m the only one here and I don’t mean to be a pessimist but I REALLY do not enjoy Tamara’s voice. This also led me to explore other apps. But I like the sleep stories they do and was able to get the app with an American Express benefit or something like that so I’ve repurchased a subscription once again. However I always gravitate to Insight Timer first if I want a true meditation which is 9/10 times or more. Hopefully this review helps someone, I think the app has improved since more variety has been added in terms of the number of Narrators available. I just wish Tamara would do less narrated meditations (sorry Tamara 😬)"
202,2020-04-26 05:01:04,2,"I have had Calm for quite some time and they have gotten far too much of my money. The sleep stories are great, but the app is NOT intuitive or user friendly and there are no helps. It crashes at random times in the middle of a story or meditation, shutting off and going back to the home page of my phone or iPad. My daughter and I like the stories for kids the best, but they have added only 1 story in the past 4 months. It’s well nigh impossible to tell what subscription you have because there is a list of 15 different price renewal options. I found out mine has been auto renewing for $15 per month, making this literally the most expensive app in my life. For that much, there should be way better helps in the app and I should be able to use it for more than 4 mins at a time without it crashing, kicking me out, or freezing up my device."
203,2019-07-22 13:39:30,1,"Thought I would try out the app? (I have trouble sleeping and been depressed lately) Think Again!!!  Unfortunately you can’t even get a trial unless you have $70 to give them for a 1 year subscription up front?!?!  My first thought when I heard about this app was that someone coming up with this idea would genuinely care and want to help people?!?!  Boy was I WRONG and disappointed when I found out that,  “surprise surprise surprise” they’re just like most everyone else and it’s all about the $$$MONEY$$$!!!!!  These little things are what end up pushing people over the edge... (because now I’m REALLY not tired and even MORE DEPRESSED) So, Thank You Calm!!!  Your app had the exact opposite effect that I was hoping for and all I did was want to check out what I thought looked and sounded like a great thing? Unfortunately I’m not rich and apparently they only offer a 1 year and not a monthly subscription? Hope the people that can afford all the good things in life enjoy this as well...  Did Donald Trump invent this app???"
204,2020-11-16 01:19:35,5,"I have been using this app for a little over two weeks now and I think it works great for anxiety or stress. The large collection of soft noises and music allows me to have a second to myself to pay attention and breathe. It also helps me to fall asleep faster. I recommend this app to everyone. In psychology class, we learned how using breathing exercises, like the ones in this app, allows our flight or fight response to simmer down and bring our anxiety levels down. Our body’s sympathetic system spikes when we run into danger. When we feel anxiety our body does the same. Calm music helps to increase our parasympathetic response which allows us to calm down. This app does just this. There are so many options and you are bound to find an exercise for you!"
205,2020-11-06 19:35:11,5,"I had been having a very bad day, I had not fallen asleep until 12 the past night, had a stressful day of online learning wrapping up the trimester, and overall VERY angry. I had remembered that I had the app calm and decided to try it out. I clicked on their “soundscapes” option and played one of their river options. I immediately relaxed and the quality of the sound - it’s amazing! It’s like I was really there! I definitely recommend this app for all sorts of things. The paying option is expensive, but I share it with someone else. The sleep stories had helped me relax and fall asleep, and I personally do not like mindfulness. Had not worked for me before and and did not think it would. I had used it and it was very well done. Incredibly calming. Seriously, use this app. It’s good."
206,2019-07-07 16:16:57,5,"I absolutely LOVE how these 10 mins sessions are designed. So effective and can easily fit in my morning routines, I rarely start my day without it now.  I love the beautiful combination of silence mediation/breath work and the inclusion of a strong moral message of the day at the end of each session. I have been using it for over a  year now, however I am excited to yet explore the other aspects of the app, that are geared to other parts of the day/emotions.  Tamara’s voice is so calming ( good choice of app name ;) and I really appreciate when she uses her own stories for the listener to resonate with. I salute you Tamara for carefully curating the lessons here and spreading the positivity  we need to love and accept ourselves first in order to give it back to the world. Thank you. Bless you and your beautiful efforts."
207,2019-01-10 17:01:41,5,"I don’t ever write reviews on apps, this is the first one that I have ever done, so this app is saying a lot already. I am a 25 y/o male and I’ve been struggling with self esteem & confidence issues for pretty much my whole life. About 3 months ago I started religiously meditating daily, not kidding you, its a boost to my self, everyday. It’s one of those things that if you don’t do it for the day, it gives you the consciousness to know that you could feel better by meditating.. when you’re feeling down, feeling stressed, not worth it, or just literally anything, Calm has a meditation for it. If this is your first time learning to meditate, give this app a shot and stick with it. It’s literally like an inner super power. Good luck with your self improvement! Much love!"
208,2018-12-14 13:52:32,5,"I gave the app calm a 5 star rateing because it has so many different ways to keep you calm you should definitely download the app calm if you have trouble getting relaxed or calm.

P.s. How you download the app calm is so you go to the app store,than once your there click on the Magna fine glass on the top or the bottom when your there press on the button that says search and a blue blinking line will come up on the side than letters should come up on the bottom than type  in ""calm"" than press search. Than look for a blue square that says calm in the middle once you find it press on it than a cricle will come up that means its downloading when its fully colored in than wate a little wile and than there will come up a button that says open your gonna press that and start your Jorrny."
209,2021-01-13 19:14:54,5,I have no regret with downloading this app. This app is so helpful when I am doing work or school and I just need a break from it all. I love all the scenes and sounds you can choose from! My favorite one is the fireplace! My recommendations would be to unlock more of the stories and sleep sounds and maybe add more mood check inns? I am not saying this to be critical at all because I love this app! Just a recommendation! My mom was actually the one who told me to download this app! She uses it all the time! Thank you so much for creating this app it helps me so much! I just started listening to the sleep stories on meditating because I have a lot going on in the pandemic and it helps so much! The creators did a great job in putting their best into this app because this app is the best! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
210,2020-11-04 02:26:41,5,"I bought this app during a deployment that was not very easy to get some shut eye. Being military, your body is pretty much trained to pass out whenever your not moving, however after the last few years of deploying, time zone changes, shift swaps, inconsiderate wall mates and the lack of understanding of ‘24 hour quite hours’ i needed something to help relax. This app, paired with Bose noise canceling headphones has saved my sanity. Throw on some bob ross or another wonderful sleep story, let the soothing sounds wash over you and drown out all the mindless chatter of the day. I also love that it plays a ‘scene’ afterwords, needing a constant ‘sound’ to over power the noises outside without being too much and this is perfect. Honestly I don’t know what I’d do without this app, especially overseas"
211,2020-01-04 18:45:53,5,"I got a free Headspace account through work, but I ended up paying for Calm because I prefer it and ended up using it way more often. I find the guided meditations better suited for what I want in my meditation time  - A little less talking, more breathing, a choice between a female and male narration (I find the female voice to be less judgmental for some reason) and topic-focused, CBT-based thought reframing. I feel more centered and inspired after each session!

The sleep stories and sleep sound libraries have become a favorite feature I didn’t know I wanted. I’ve been having some stress-related insomnia here and there, and the bedtime audio options pair really well with a lavender essential oil diffuser for relaxation and creating an enjoyable sleep hygiene routine. 

Keep it up, Calm team! I love this product."
212,2020-10-06 16:54:51,4,"This app changed my life on an everyday basis. I finally learned what it really means to meditate and it’s been helping me ever since. HOWEVER...if you need help or have a question, you are only offered bot responses. Anything outside of basic “how to” and you hit the impenetrable wall that most tech companies create...no human to talk to...a big contrast to the way you would expect a wellness app to operate. 
My biggest issue is that your courses do not translate across devices so when you move from Apple TV to my iPad - The iPad doesn’t know that you’ve already started the course and wants to start you from the beginning again. Also, it would be great to be able to buy some of the music that they offer… But no one to talk to or ask about any of this!

 If you want people to be happy and calm you have to give them support!"
213,2020-04-18 22:31:57,1,"Ok, I found the idea of this app excellent! But there’s one major catch... money. Of course I should never have assumed that this app would be any different from all the others, but I was shocked at how little was provided for those who can’t afford the subscription... I understand the need to make money to keep the app up and running... but I couldn’t believe the price and just how many things were not allowed to a free user... I’m really disappointed in this app to be honest... I think the idea of it is great, but with the hefty price I don’t think I would ever be able to feel “calm” I just don’t really understand how one can feel calm when I would absolutely be thinking the whole time “how could I pay so much for this app?! I already worry about money! Why in the world would I do that?! I should cancel my subscription! I need that money for my rent, my groceries, my LIFE!” So ya... the idea of an app helping you achieve mindfulness is great. The price and stingy policies, not so great."
214,2019-08-18 19:18:25,5,"Teachers - it’s free! There is an ENTIRE section for kids of all ages, through college, in addition to the adult courses.

For anyone else, spend the $60 and challenge yourself to listen to just one 12 minute Daily Calm per day. It’ll even remind you at set times.

Before you know it, you will want to go thru all the vast and constantly growing content.

The MasterClasses are fantastic, especially the one on Discovering Happiness. Between meditations on different subjects to short guided yoga segments to OMG the Sleep Stories - this app has honestly changed my life and how I am dealing with every single thing in life, good, bad and ugly. 

There is something for every part of the day. Most segments are a bit over ten minutes but there are longer as well.  There are too many options to list! And even just the sounds (waves to lakes to cat purring) are great to have in the background, especially if like me, you get a little overstimulated and benefit from gentle white noise as a reminder to slow down.

I am so in love with this app!!! Best $60 I’ve spent in ages, although I originally thought it was billed $5/month. At least it prompts me to get as much as I can out of it. 

Make the investment in YOU. I promise you won’t regret it."
215,2019-05-29 13:05:35,5,"For the past 4-5 years I have had sleep insomnia, I’ll lay down in bed early, turn everything off, relax and get comfortable, and still my wheels turn for hours. When I do fall asleep I never dream, and I wake up about every hour tossing and turning, even if initially falling asleep on my back. I tried this app by referral, and the first thing I listened to was “Wonder” narrated by Matthew Mcconaughey. I’m still not exactly sure how, but I must’ve fallen asleep shortly before the story was over. I had a dream that seemed to make up for the past few years because it went on forever. I slept for 7 hours, only waking up twice. Needless to say, I will be using this app regularly. I’m very grateful for everyone who puts effort into this app. As cheesy as it may sound, it’s changing my life."
216,2018-09-27 14:08:04,5,"Sometimes life sends you a lesson so overwhelming you want to roll up, hide and never come out. This app as part of my morning routine and evening sleep helped to root me in being present and mindful so that I could take the action I needed to make a comeback. I’m so grateful for this app. I do use a couple of others as well but Calm offers a wide range of what you need. *My only hint to any of you is this ** while you’re pursuing clam and peace take note that it is present and presence as well as curiosity and acceptance of self that you’re after. This is what give you the calm before taking action. And, taking action as a centered person who knows who you are and your beliefs, is what will give you more growth and satisfaction in life. I wish you all well. Holly from ComebackMama"
217,2017-09-03 15:38:12,5,"A friend at work told me about Calm. I have been experiencing anxiety and wanted to try meditating. I want going to take a class, but this app came along. First, I used the free options: falling asleep to the stories (I love this! Like being a kid.  It is really soothing!) & meditations in the morning. I could feel a difference in how I was feeling in a few days, so I paid for the yearly subscription. Probably the cost of two sessions with a teacher. Now, I meditate every morning (daily calm and one other, depending on how I'm feeling) and it starts my day in new frame of mind. My husband has been doing them with me, too.  He was never interested in anything like this. I recommend this app to anyone looking to try meditation and sleep better. It's a part of my daily life now and it's making my life better!"
218,2018-02-04 10:26:33,2,"Bought the original version. After the original update, it became a subscription service. Now, after the latest update, it won’t even open. Don’t bother.
** I have added one star because they at least took the effort to fix the fact that it wouldn’t open. It worked, but I had figured that out 3 weeks before their response. I still am not happy that as an early adopter to this app, I helped pave the way for a subscription app that is several times more expensive than my original purchase. This was the first and only app that I had ever paid for, and this is the perfect example why I don’t buy apps.  I liked what I purchased, but it has changed into something completely different, and now I have to pay extra to enjoy its full benefit. Bad karma folks. Thanks for trying to help me with part of my issue. If you want anything more from me, you’ll have to address the full complaint.**"
219,2020-05-04 01:35:04,3,"I’m comparing this app with my favorite meditation app, which is surprisingly Peloton’s app. I don’t like the lack of new content on Calm. Also, most of the meditations seem to be led by Tamara Levitt and I find her voice to be more annoying than soothing. She talks like a cinematic actress or a hypnotist and not just a person doing a meditation. What I love about Peloton is that they’re constantly adding new content and you have 5 different people you can listen to for all sorts of meditations. I think different personalities will speak to you and this app is disappointing, especially considering it’s $70/yr subscription. I’m also not into sleep stories. I want a nice 10-15 minute meditation before I go to bed and I want choice and perhaps some New Age music playing in the background. After having it several months I’ve cancelled the subscription since I now favor Peloton to Calm."
220,2017-09-01 03:56:08,5,"This is a well thought out application for meditation and has strong anchors in psychology..  As a psychologist I weekly recommend this app to my patients to use to quell and address anxiety and sleep issues.  The research is sound and the principals realistically discuss that facing and accepting anxiety (however paradioical) works!  I like how the app states to accept the thought and to let it float on by.  Awareness is a strong tool in strengthening our self esteem.  Self care makes us stronger and more compassionate individuals where we can give back and support our families, friends and communities.  This is positive psychology in its truest form.  Keep up the good work.  Now for more programs for kids and teens.   And perhaps setting up meditation centers in schools.  Excellent and well thought out.  Thanks for all of your hard work"
221,2020-03-30 15:49:20,5,"I’m a user for years now and these are some of my reflections. The thing about meditation is that you probably have all the tools without this app. What I appreciate is Tamara’s voice (the main person doing the guided meditations) and the topics that change everyday. Kind of like a meditation plus someone telling you to be in the present and that your feelings are valid. There is also other things they’ve added over the years like soundscapes and sleep stories and music. Since I’ve been working on my mediation practice I appreciate that it logs your sessions. Also, maybe it’s just me but it feels satisfying to see the quote and image after you finish your meditation for the day (it feels like a reward,  but it’s really a reminder of that day’s lesson)."
222,2019-10-10 14:21:47,5,"I love this app so, so, so much.  It has many sessions and options.  Meditations of varying subjects and lengths.  I love Tamara’s voice.  She’s so calm and intelligent in her meditation practices knowledge.  I have a lot of stress (husband of 27 years recently blind sided me with divorce papers), fighting depression and bucketfuls of anxiety.  Eating and sleeping issues.  There are mediations covering all those issues and more.  There are sleep story aids, soothing music.  There’s a calendar to keep track of your sessions.  I use this app everyday day.  Sometimes multiple sessions a day.  Sometimes I like a session so much I will listen to it more than once.  If you’re looking for soothing, easy, judgement free guided meditation, you can’t go wrong with Calm.  WELL worth the nominal fee.  I recommend this app to anyone and everyone."
223,2019-11-30 12:10:37,1,"Tamara’s voice, which is the only option for the majority of sleep meditations, is like listening to an SNL skit of how to be an annoying millennial. Nasal. False bubbly and so very forced. I appreciate she writes the meditations and is responsible for the app, but she needs to step aside and let anyone else (all the other leaders/voices are soothing and relaxing) do the talking. Definitely she needs to cut the singsong nasal California girl “Hi! I’m Tamara”. Major jolt out of relaxation to start. She has that annoying vocal delivery that makes you mimic her because it’s so over the top. When she starts tLiimg, I expect  “oh my god! Did you SEE what Nadine was wearing yesterday?” “Oh my God, I had the most amaaaazing açaí bowl today! It was like so healthy too because they put like these seed things in it” “OMG! I am SO over lululemon!” “OMG she’s such a boomer!” “Omg! Is that a wrinkle!?!?!? [SCREAMS]. The app would be great but I bought it for sleep meditation. Now I have to go elsewhere to find a decent soothing voice. If you speak French, the French voices are lovely."
224,2019-11-12 00:42:47,4,"Hello Calm,
I started using your app in 2015 when I was going through chemo. It truly saved me as I was terribly sick. You app combined with the ‘Sleepphones’ have been a saving grace for me. However! The story list has morphed into so many children stories, it is really disappointing. I pay a LOT of money for this app annually and nearly half of the content is now children’s. The new Time Machine story is not produced well and is greatly overshadowed by music. Mathew McConaughey’s story is by far your best, mostly because of his voice! Many women’s voices are just not soothing enough, but I am picky as my sleep issues are threaded with PTSD.
I just don’t feel like I’m getting my money’s worth recently. I’ve started listening to Slumber. I hope your content evolves back to more adult stories. Thank you for what you have done so far."
225,2019-10-30 07:03:06,1,"I would give this app a 0star if I could simply because while the app is free to download you can’t access any of the stories,meditations etc. without a subscription. They fail to mention this in any of their ads they push the free word a lot I find this to be very poor business practices. Yes they offer a 7 day free trial but if you do t continue the subscription the app is basically useless I found 2 things I could access without paying and even if you can download during the free trial once you cancel you only have what you could download and how many time will one want to listen to the same story/ meditation or whatever. I really feel they should explain in their ads that a subscription is needed the they are advertising to people with anxiety sleep issues etc so I feel it’s terrible business practice to offer people hope of some relief and then say oh but you must pay for it even though we said it’s free technically the app is free but it’s useless"
226,2019-05-01 11:01:34,5,"My husband passed away unexpectedly, and I immediately started waking up after being asleep for a couple of hours and not being able to fall back asleep. I became desperate to figure out how to get back to sleep fast.

That’s when I searched for sleep apps and liked the way Calm sounded.

I don’t know what I would do without the sleep stories. I put one on when I wake up at night and within 5 to 10 minutes I’m back asleep. They constantly add new ones,  and I really love the travel ones. They also have sleep meditations that work great too. I don’t like hokey meditations as I am a Christian. These are straight forward and practical. They have fantastic meditation series for daytime that as a bonus helps me stay focused as well as help to cope with grief and anxiety. 

If I’m waiting somewhere like a doctors office, they have master classes on different subjects like parenting that I can listen to as well.

This app is a must have if you struggle to go to sleep or stay asleep or simply want to help stay in control more of your emotions. It is truly a God send and a blessing worth every penny.

I’m so grateful for it as it has changed our lives. My daughter loves the kids bedtime stories too."
227,2019-01-21 13:53:32,5,"I needed something. For years I needed centering. I’ve always tried meditating but just couldn’t make it happen. I started with the free calm app. Tried the 7 days of Calm. 10 minute timed meditations. I skipped days, on days I did practice my mind wandered. Sometimes weeks went by before I practiced again. But every time I did it, it got better. I got more out of it. My anxiety lessened and then disappeared. Joyfulness snuck into my everyday life. Mindfulness has become a daily necessity for me. I just beat my streak and am progressing happily. Currently on a 140 day mindfulness streak and am so thankful for what I have learned through this app. No, you do not need it to practice mindfulness but the guidance has been so beneficial to my daily practice. I will never give this up and am thankful that I found this app."
228,2018-06-21 14:33:12,5,"I have anxiety, depression, and nerve pain (peripheral neuropathy). Plus lots of regular life stress with family, work.  Downloaded this app after trying out another one referred by a friend.  That didn’t work as well for me. 
Was drawn to Calm because of the soothing background options. Used sporadically at first, now I use it in the morning regularly, and at night if I can.  At night I like inner peace and self-care meditations. 
The sleep stories are the best. I have disturbed sleep and wake up around 3 or 4 am. Instead of staying up overthinking and in pain for hours like I used to do, I listen to the nightly sleep story. Now I fall back to sleep within minutes and don’t get to finish the whole story. Favorites so far have been Bob Ross and Sleeping Beauty read by Nick Viall from The Bachelor."
229,2020-08-13 23:34:00,5,"I’m getting emotional even writing this review!  This app is everything you could want and more. Between the daily mood check ins, the creative calming stories, the playlists, the sleep aids and the master classes, this app is about so much more than “just” meditation. It’s a full on mental wellness app, giving you the tools to improve your own life. It prompts important thoughts that you would never think of on your own. If you’re having trouble in any area of life, this can make a difference. 

Spring for the annual premium package. I never ever buy this kind of stuff but this was so worth it!  I think it was only like $60? And it gives you access to all the things that make this app so special. Plus it’s much cheaper than therapy lol."
230,2018-01-26 14:51:31,3,"This has been plagued with bugs for some time now and maybe it would be better if I paid for it, but I agree with others, the price is ridiculous. For a while it wouldn’t open at all, I’ve reinstalled several times and now I can’t sign in because another button is on top of the sign in button or the ad to buy a subscription won’t go away. Completely useless! Here was my original review which moves the rating from 5 stars to 1: Whether you are new to meditation, and have no clue where to start, or are skilled, and simply want timers, this app is perfect...and I have only used the free parts of it so far!
Update: The developer contacted me and for now the app is working, but even the link they sent in my email wouldn’t work, so apparently there have been a lot of changes and bugs are being worked out, we shall see 😉 Meditation shouldn’t be so stressful to achieve."
231,2019-10-19 12:55:38,5,"At 53 I had three strokes and recovered faster than doctors believed. They attributed that to “pristine” arteries due to my whole food plant based diet. What I had not worked on was managing stress and anxiety. I was told I would be on the three stokes meds for life. (BP, Cholesterol and blood thinners) I added Calm in January and daily exercise a month ago. I am beyond thrilled to say that I am down to 20mg - expecting to be off of them at my next doctor visit - of the cholesterol meds and - the biggest thrill - off my BP meds completely. I have survived things like children driving alone to far a way places which in the past would have meant anxiety pills, popcorn and sitting on the couch staring at their location on my phone. Calm helps you realize the importance of stopping and looking inside. Give it a try!"
232,2019-03-19 23:44:52,5,"So i’ve been using calm for a few days, and it is really helping me!! This app is so great, and i feel relaxed and clam when i use it! But i was going to do seven days of sleep, and i had already done the one day. I tried to do the next day, but i needed calm premium in order to do this! So that’s one of the problems! There is barely anything you can do on there when you don’t have calm premium! And another thing is that i feel like $70 is a lot for one year! I mean like, get it, like you need to make money, but you should try to lower the price just a bit! But that’s just my opinion. So i really do think that it’s a good app and all, those two things just really got me! But as i said before, it’s a rally great app for meditating and all, like it is calming and relaxing!"
233,2019-08-28 11:47:55,2,"I am warning you don't buy it is a waste of storage and time. I mean if u have a lot of money and i mean ($62 a year) go ahead spend your money but for the middle class out here we don't have money to be buying useless things we are probably only going to use once. Now lets go down into the pros and cons of the app. The cons are that it is a lot of money just to use the app, and that they only give one thing from each category if you decide to not buy the subscription and they are normally the ones no one one wants to use. Now on with the pros with the app is that as soon as you sign up the email you a 40% discount on that years subscription but sadly there is a con to that I forgot to mention. The discount only last for that year and that it the offer only last that night so after midnight your offer is gone so i hope you enjoy my experience with the app and i hope you have a good day."
234,2020-06-06 02:58:33,5,"From the moment of my first meditation session I’ve been hooked! I have Tourette Syndrome so my mind is constantly stressed and on high-alert. However, I found that during mediating, my motor tics vanished! I admit, I had my doubts about this app. I’m usually not too good at mediating and it sometimes brought me more stress than relaxation. But the narrator walks you through it and keeps you focused and calm. It’s like you step outside of your body and go to a sort of spiritual place. You won’t believe it until you try it and I highly recommend that you do! 

Great for stress, trouble sleeping, sadness, reducing stress from  Tourette Syndrome (and things alike), etc. Basically, if you’re feeling down, angry, stressed, guilty, grief, lost, or overall just not good—then this app is definitely for you!"
235,2021-01-10 03:03:42,2,"Would be 5 stars besides the fact that you can’t ask Siri to play the daily calm.   For example if you can’t sleep they are asking to open your phone (waking you up more!) to then open the app, select a sleep story, open the air play menu, then finally select a HomePod from the menu.  What’s even the point?  If I even glance at my fantasy league or some thing because I opened my phone for calm because I can’t ask my HomePod to just play calm.  The Siri shortcut is no better you have to continue on your iPhone, same thing look at your phone.  The money you pay this should’ve been taken care of by now.  Apple has given the developer the tools with Sirikit media.  This is not unreasonable and for a app claiming to be about mindfulness you’d figure less screen time would be a top goal.  If this isn’t resolved by the end of my subscription year I won’t be renewing.  Content great, falls on app development"
236,2020-04-12 14:31:07,5,"I love calm all and of it stories. Also the fact that calm is the only thing that helps me sleep. I had a sleeping problem and I  hated going to sleep and I’d just stay up to a very late time where I’d only get a small amount of sleep. But then I found calm where I can just relax and listen to calming stories that I never finish because I’d already be asleep! When I rely on it, it never fails me. It works every time!! I also like how every morning calm asks you how you slept and that every time I get to put “great” as my answer. I would never delete this app it is a miracle worker and helps me sleep like nothing else does!⭐️ That is all I have to say for now!😊I’ve encountered no bugs or anything needing to be fixed thank for the app That has helped me so much! 💗"
237,2020-01-04 22:25:17,5,"I have found the calm app to be a daily transcript for peaceful, mindful living. It is so easy to quickly feel overwhelmed,!stressed out and frazzled in today’s technological minute to minute incessant barrage of information. Our world has become bombarded with uninvited interruptions as if this is the norm. 
The calm helps one to return to that peaceful, blissful place that is so necessary and reminds us that space and peace and calmness are some of the keys to obtaining an inward fulfilling place. The inner space that regulates our interaction with those things outside of us that demand our consciousness whether invited or not. The calm helps us stay in touch with that divine inner spirituality that can be considered a regulator of sorts that provides a strong boundary for successful containment of the the things we choose to be important !"
238,2020-04-04 03:55:55,2,"I was gifted Calm as a gift and really enjoyed it initially. However in these uncertain & stress inducing times, Calm has not addressed it. The Daily Calm hasn’t address it and seems disconnected from what is happening.  This was my meditation app & it’s very disappointing that there’s nothing to address the stress and anxiety and roller coaster of emotions that have come with COVID19. 

Additionally, the meditation options have not changed much in the 3+ months that I’ve had the app. The breath of topics are wonderful but once you completed the available meditations, that’s it, no more are offered. For example, I stared the kids meditation with my daughters and they loved it but there were only 4 sessions offered for their age group & after awhile they refused to repeat the same meditation they had already done that week.  

 It started out very promising but has fallen short. I was very disappointed that the meditation offerings did not grow over time."
239,2019-09-29 07:10:07,5,"I never leave reviews, but this app is so good I had to give it 5 stars. Meditation is my passion, and I’ve tried every app; Calm is by far the best. The ability to have and change the background noise is a total game changer! The sound scapes are wonderful falling asleep tools, and the variety of voices keeps things fresh. 
But my favorite feature by far is the ability to manually enter meditation you do off the app- it allows for a better record of your habits. Calm premium is worth every penny, I recommend it to all my students (I’m a yoga teacher) and my friends and family as well. Calm is the perfect tool for beginners, as well as the perfect tool for intermediate & advanced meditators because it’s got such a wide variety of topics. I’d give it more stars if I could."
240,2020-09-03 19:31:07,5,"As adults, we often forget how effective a bedtime story is to help us sleep. I guess that’s why our parents read them to us as kids to calm us down and get us to drift off to sleep. We perpetuate the practice with our own children and they will with theirs. It’s a magical formula that seems to work like a charm every time. This app has some of the best sleep stories for grownups and kids alike. The narrators are very skilled at reading softly and slowly and the stories often interjecting sleep suggestions get your mind prepared for sleep. One of my favorites is Harry Styles who’s soft droning voice has lulled me to sleep many a night. I highly recommend this app for everyone. I got it through my health insurance plan and it’s one of the best services they’ve ever provided."
241,2021-02-26 18:24:59,3,"Edit: reducing to 3 stars until this stops randomly playing scenes in the background. I reached out to support and have not seen a reply. Has been over a month.

Calm has become a huge part of my life. I’m on my 2nd year of my subscription and I am not looking back. I have grown substantially personally since starting this journey, and every day I deepen my understanding of my mind and how I view and interact with the world. I find Calm to be a blessing and it is regularly in my list of gratitudes. I think this is my most frequently recommended app, as it is the ultimate mental knife sharpener. You can better almost any aspect of your life with a daily sit. This may be the longest app review I’ve ever written, and that’s because it’s warranted. I wish I could give this app 10 stars as it is a life changer and I am eternally grateful for the course adjustments it has helped me make in my life."
242,2019-09-22 12:28:41,5,"Calm is the very best app there is for meditating,  and the sleep stories are absolutely wonderful. I recommend this app to everyone right now because everyone needs to meditate and almost everyone has A hard time sleeping at times. This is the only app that continues to be free for sleep stories and all kinds of meditation. Continuing to be free and not making me pay for the app means everything to me. ALL the other Apps for Meditating stop at a certain point and you can’t go any further until you pay, and That is why I love this app!! A lot of us cannot afford to pay for some apps and I really really appreciate Calm  being there for me. If I ever win the lottery I will definitely upgrade. Once again thank you for being there I love Calm. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😘😘👍👌🙏🙏🙏"
243,2020-03-24 21:29:31,2,"Hello first of all this is a great app and has so many wonderful ways to help with emotions, meditation and general well being. Thing is I have misophonia which is a neurological condition for hatred of certain sounds. During my free app usage I did not really get use out of the different programs mainly I got it to listen to stories from certain actors whom I love the sound of their voices. I purchased it thinking about what perfect timing with the new stresses of covid-19. But here’s my issue almost everyone I would like to listen to has only Tamara Levitt’s voice. I’m sure she is a wonderful person but I have a hard time with the whistle at the end of her sentences and the use of the letter “S”. So instead of calming me down triggers my misophonia and I end up having to shut it off. Is there any way to have ALL the programs on here have a choice between 2 different voices? Specifically ones without wet mouth and exaggerated “S” sounds?"
244,2020-11-11 07:25:34,5,Hi I am really enjoying the calm app. At first I did not like the sound of Tamra Levitt voice because it wasn’t relaxing to me. She narrates the majority of the meditations. But I am getting used to her voice and also there are a lot of meditations where you have the option of a male narrator with a more calming voice. I do wish they had a female narrator with a lower tone voice. It’s important to have a variety of voices and not use one voice for the majority of the meditations because that voice could not soothe some people. I have trouble with high pitched voices while meditating. But so far I am really enjoying the app because it is helping me limit my social media activity and I just feel better being on this app then on Instagram or TickTock etc.
245,2018-11-29 08:23:38,3,"I used this app religiously to help me sleep because of my anxiety. It would be so hard for me to fall asleep at night until I found the Calm App and would listen to the soothing sleep music! I used this app for about a year and I wasn’t charged for anything, which I loved because it was so effective and I didn’t have to worry about putting a dent in my pocket. I only used the sleep music, so I didn’t see the point in purchasing a membership. Now, my anxiety is coming back to me before bedtime and I can’t use this app because ALL of the music is locked!! I understand that money has to be made somehow, but I’m so truly disappointed every single song was locked. I’m a college student on a budget that can’t afford to pay for miscellaneous things so this hurts! Anyway, if you have the money I’d definitely recommend this app. It works wonders!"
246,2019-03-11 14:39:34,5,"I have been dealing with insomnia for years now. I’ve tried herbs, oils, prescription meds, diet, exercise, and bedtime routine. All work for a short period of time, but the night waking with the incessant thoughts never end. I looked into meditation and came across this app. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me! For the first time in years, although I wake up through the night, with the help of the sleep releases and/or the bedtime stories, my mind is quieted and I go back to sleep! I do one meditation through the day and feel it helps me with my focus through the night. I have a ways to go to be an awesome meditator, but this app is awesome! I can’t stress that enough! I’ve been using it for a month. It has been worth every dollar spent! I highly recommend it!"
247,2018-08-08 03:19:59,5,"I downloaded this app as I was going through issues with my treatment for depression.  I have never been good at the relaxation portion of yoga, but found I truly was needing to find away to help myself focus and care for myself.  I couldn’t believe how quickly I fell asleep after doing a body scan & listening to a sleep story. 

I still am not practicing ideally, listening to meditations on walks, while driving, or while doing work, but I am moved by the lessons in the different areas and need these gems of insight.   This practice is getting me closer to catching up on things at work and getting me to that place where I can truly practice meditative moments.  
I look forward to continuing and improving upon my practice and finding some inward quiet and peace."
248,2020-10-09 11:04:39,5,"I started listening as an experiment since I work shift work and swap from days to nights weekly. After the first session, my husband asked, “Will you play me a sleep story before bed?”! I was in absolute shock! Even when I stay awake past his routine bed time to swap my schedule, I have to play him a story and he is sound asleep within a few minutes (maybe even seconds). I have also noticed our four dogs are enjoying the relaxing voices and sounds. All four are soundly dreaming shortly after the beginning and have started to expect a story as well! They snuggle down in their specific spots and wait with anticipation! I am excited to have found something that finally helps with my insomnia due to shift work!"
249,2020-07-18 04:18:37,5,"When I say a use calm everyday and night I mean it. It’s helped me with my anxiety so much. I feel so much more relaxed then before. I have had calm for almost two years now and decided to finally write a review since it’s so good. Everything about calm makes you feel like everything’s going to be okay and that your also being wrapped up in a warm hug!

A suggestion: Since I have zero complaints, here’s a little thing for a sound series since you do some with pop music and such as calm remixes. Try to do some anime songs as a slowed down and calmer version. I bet there are more people out there who would want this as anime can be a sort of relief and break from reality and I find if it were mixed with calm it would be so much better ❤️"
250,2019-08-16 12:15:06,5,"This is my first foray into meditation. This app was recommended to me by my manager. I work in a very chaotic and stressful field with lots of high and lots of lows. It’s so easy to get swept up into the mindset you’re not enough, and allow that anxiety and stress negatively affect your self love. For the last couple weeks, using calm for 10-20 minutes a day, I feel more relaxed, and areas in my life even outside of the office have had positive impact. I’m working out harder in the gym, I’m more open with friends and family, and the gratitude that I’m feeling right now is immense compared to just a couple of weeks ago. This app is pricey at $70 dollars. But that’s less than one therapy session. And i believe it will, with time, make me a happier and better version of myself."
251,2020-04-03 17:08:40,5,I’m a 10 year old girl and I have major anxiety because in the year 2015 my parents got divorced and I was fine with that but now in 2019 a.k.a last year the day after Christmas I went to my dads house and had anxiety and could not sleep at all. But when I got this app it saved me and whenever I feel stressed I will listen to one of the videos they recommend for me and I feel like the anxiety that has taken over me has been defeated by this app calm. I definitely recommend this app it is a life saver if you have anxiety like I do. Also if you can’t fall asleep then you can listen to story’s if you are an adult or a kid and you can listen to nap time music. One time when I listened to the nap time music and I fell asleep on the couch for an hour.
252,2017-12-15 17:41:00,1,"The app is flawed. Bottom line. Caching and syncing aside the app fails to create a consistent experience regardless of time zone and that is a flaw. Customer service looses credibility when they try to explain it away as if that is just the way it is or has to be. They attempt to talk circles around the average consumer because they don't know the wiser. That non-explination falls flat to me because I am a digital communications major who is well versed in tech.

Instead of trying to explain away this unfortunate product shortcoming they should try and practice service recovery and invest in the app to bring it up to speed w/their competitors.

I am extremely disappointed. I will be deleting the app and moving on. If they knew anything about customer service recovery they would do something or offer a make-good instead of crafting big-word excuses.

Customer service turnaround time is horrible as well. I sent over my original concern on a Saturday and it took them 4 whole business days to respond. So lame. This is how companies get washed out in this digital landscape. Here today, gone tomorrow. I have a decent amount of influence in my social circles and have encouraged friends and family to download and use Calm. I will now, based on this conversation, fire up the App Store and move on to a competitor...and so will they.

Do better. Don't make excuses. Take action."
253,2018-07-08 15:17:43,5,"My husband used headspace and I use Calm, and let me just say that Calm has truly out paced HS by FAR. I have anxiety to the point of panic attacks and this app was suggested by a therapist to me; it has truly helped me learn how to breathe and stay in the moment during difficult reactions. They offer frequent new content that is relevant, master classes, whole topical series, simple bells and a timer, download options, favorite your go-to sessions... it is all here. Track your progress if you like to see that as well. Not only that but the UI is lovely and beautifully simple. This is by far the most value for an annual premium subscription I’ve ever gotten out of an app and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’re on the fence about which one to try, please try this one."
254,2020-01-29 02:03:37,4,"I just don’t get it. Why do have to waste your time to buy Calm Premium, just to feel happy and calm yourself?! Everything is AMAZING! Besides you have to PAY to ease your mind. I would love to listen to the stories, the music, and to fall asleep, but I can’t 😒😞😠🤧 My New Year’s resolution was to become a healthier person mentally, physically, and emotionally. I’ve also been trying to fix my sleep schedule, but it’s kinda hard because of the things I need to UNLOCK! This really pisses me off. JUST MAKE EVERYTHING FREE! My gosh 😫😩!!! And I’m not buying it! I hate those types of apps... But seriously, do you think you have to give MONEY to become a better person? Make it freeeee! If it’s not free in 2 months, I’m deleting. Which will be very hard because I love it! Pleaseee 🥺 thanks for reading have a great day/night! 💕"
255,2019-12-08 07:06:26,4,"One of the best apps out there. I use it every day and also at night for sleep. Music selections are exceptional. My only issue is the voice of Tamara Levitt, the narrator (and I believe brilliant creator) of Daily Calm. The content is great: it’s the vocal affectation that I find grating. Like another reviewer, I’ve tried and tried to no avail. My only resort is to turn it down to lowest audible volume. During the didactic part of the meditation, the voice changes to something more authentic, but then, relapses to the vocal fry and breathiness that seems designed to enhance the meditation experience. It obviously works for many users, and there’s no doubt that Tamara possesses wisdom and us a gifted teacher. I just wish she could lose the affectation and talk to us in her normal conversational voice. Barring that, maybe offer another narrator."
256,2020-10-20 00:09:36,5,"When I saw calm I wanted to get it so badly so I did and so now it is helping me a lot. The meditation videos are helping me calm my mind down after a hard day. I do not care if some people do not like the app and say that it is bad and you shouldn’t get it. I recommend this app because I believe that it might help you sleep or relive stress. I got this app today and loved it. I hope that if you get it to you will like it. When ever I get a app and then look at the reviews I never listen to them. I listen only to what my mind says. If it tells me to get the app, I will get it. If it doesn’t want me to get it, I won’t. Thank you for reading my review and I hope that you will have a great day and that you have a good time while you are on the app.🐺"
257,2019-12-02 03:21:41,5,"I know as a college student I'm not the majority population of this app and 30-60$ for a subscription is definitely still steep to me but I can honestly say this app is life changing.

I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and depression which is a wonderful combination of no focus and no sleep. I was recommended to start a mindfulness practice and it took about a month of cutting out my coffee budget to buy my first subscription.

I've been a member for 3 years now and I always make sure to have this in my budget: I finally have a regular sleep cycle, my focus has improved greatly, and I was able to reduce the amount of medication I had to take.

People who have known me for years have noticed I'm happier, kinder, and FAR less stressed. It took about a month or two for me to  really commit myself but I have not regretted it since and I'm actually saving up for the lifetime subscription! 

TD;DR: It looks pricey, it takes time, but it's worth it and it works.

Update: finally saved enough to get the lifetime subscription, it’s my go to app for sleep and stress relief and was absolutely worth the money. Really hoping they expand more on the breathe bubble and sleep soundscapes!"
258,2019-10-18 10:24:04,5,"Tamara Levitt’s voice is so soothing, I have been listening to the daily calm for almost a year.  When my anxiety spikes, I take a time out and use one of the body scans or meditations.  This app has helped me with night terrors, anxiety attacks, depression, and PTSD for almost a year.  Honestly, I don’t know if I would have gotten through some of my traumatic hurdles without it.  The children’s bedtime stories helped soothe my two young grandchildren when they would stay with us, and my friend’s two small children who recently lost their father.  And let’s be honest...there’s nothing better than Matthew McConaughey reading you a bedtime story!  Thank you to the creators of this app.  I promote it and share it constantly.  Tamara is my personal rock. 💜💜"
259,2019-06-26 18:00:23,5,"I cannot day enough wonderful things about using this app!! It’s been a year now, and this app has allowed me to reach a level of personal care that I have been craving since my teens and 20’s... and I’m finally finding it in my 40’s🥰.... it has made it more accessible to do these meditations on my breaks from work or and especially during really emotional days, when I seem to need it the most! Thank You Tamara Levitt and the many others involved in creating and contributing to this app!! Your beautiful words and thoughtful care you put into each one is truly life changing! I look forward to my daily calm every morning and evening!! Thank you from one deeply grateful and compassionate heart to your truly compassionate heart!♥️❤️🥰✨~ Shaun from Santa Cruz, Ca."
260,2018-04-19 13:31:27,5,"I’ve been using Calm for almost 3 years now on an almost daily basis. I think it did help me with a lot of issues and I do begin to notice benefits from using it in my life. The reason why I’m only giving 4 stars is that the „Daily Calm” sessions, something I used to look forward to, have been simple replays of previous sessions for a while now. That’s annoying, especially since they let you save your favorite sessions. So it happened to me a couple of times now that I played one of my favorite sessions and then the following day I listen to the exact same thing as a “daily Calm” because it’s being replayed. I think the daily sessions should be new, otherwise I feel a little fooled. Other than that I really like it."
261,2017-09-13 13:01:26,5,"I have been using CALM for almost two months .  I love it.  What a perfect way to start my day.  I am actually learning to meditate and be mindful.  Not, just mouthing the words.  I'm almost 72 and this it fills me with happiness to have found this wonderful gift to myself.  Thank you, Calm.
       Update..  I've been using Calm for four months now.  My husband and I do the daily meditation together each morning.  What a great , positive, way to begin our day.  I continue to be amazed by the sleep stories.  They put me right back to sleep if I wake up anxious about something in the middle of the night. A train ride through Siberia, more knowledge about sheep than I could ever imagine, lavender fields.  Smile.  They are like a magic trick. Thank you, Calm, for brightening my life."
262,2018-09-06 16:54:32,5,"This is the first time I’ve suffered anxiety because I have always been able to manage my emotions with very little difficulty. But recently it has been triggered and it has thrown me for a loop. 
Insomnia has come with the anxiety which has me up all night and going to sleep 😴 💤 on my buses to my Psych Group Therapy, then half way into my group therapy. The medication I was prescribed was making the insomnia worse, along with the anxiety about the insomnia. 
     Smooth Jazz use to help me a lot, but now is to fast and to loud. Calm is just boring enough, no calming enough😇to put me to sleep while I’m writing this review😊LOL!!! 
     I am loving Calm so much, so very very much. Thank you 🙏🏾 and may God Bless y’all and y’alls staff and Bussiness all the days of y’alls lives. 
     James A Boston Jr"
263,2020-11-12 08:49:24,3,"I just can’t handle the voice that Tamara uses in her meditations. I wish I had realized how much of the content in the app is with her reading before buying a year. I have no ill will towards Tamara herself, and she seems to be a wonderful person. 

But she puts on this fake voice when she does her readings, and it just sounds like the least genuine thing I’ve ever heard. It completely pulls me out of meditating because it feels so forced and fake. I put on Wind in the Willows for my daughter and Tamara’s voice sounded borderline inappropriate for kids with how breathy and passionate she tries to sound. 

Tamara, with all respect, PLEASE consider using your normal speaking voice which is already perfectly pleasant! You already have a lovely voice! You don’t need to go so hard with the breathy false enthusiasm. It genuinely is a deal breaker for so much of the app’s content and it bums me out."
264,2020-09-14 04:07:16,1,"In my personal experience, this app did not help me at all. In fact made my anxiety and insomnia worse. This app may work for a lot of people but i do suggest you start off with  a trial to see if it works for you. DO NOT get a subscription that is yearly unless you are completely and totally certain you will be using Calm and be committed to it. I tried to cancel my subscription and it had gave me a notice that it in fact did cancel but, i had chosen the yearly subscription and it has yet to fully cancel. I canceled my subscription months ago and it is still billing me for the app that I am no longer using. It says it won't stop the payment until the renewal date which is in February. That means it will continue to charge me for the next 4 months even though I had rightfully cancelled my subscription. I am quite disappointed in this app as a whole but I'm sure each experience is different for every person."
265,2020-04-12 16:41:50,3,"Great meditations, but extremely annoying glitches. When searching through the meditations, it doesn’t show which ones you’ve completed. And there is no way to mark one as completed yourself. So you’re looking through ones you’ve already done, and you have to just remember every one you’ve done. 
Also for series, when you open the app, there’s no option to start the next meditation in the series. So I go to last completed my history, thinking there’s some “continue to next” option. Nope, can’t do that either. And there is no option to search. So every time you want the next meditation in a series, you have to scroll until you can find that series again, and remember which one you’re on. 
As much as I love the meditations, I probably will not purchase again next year unless changes are made."
266,2020-10-09 11:56:48,5,"I rarely pay for subscriptions, but the full version of Calm has been one of the best investments I have made in my well-being. As a positive psychology practitioner, I love that Calm content is rooted in positive psychology. Learning to meditate from the ground up has increased my self-awareness, made me less reactive and allowed me to be more present and joyful. The sleep stories have improved the quality of my sleep as well as given me a wonderful way to wind down at night. The master classes cover a broad range of wellness topics with practical takeaways from experts in their field.  And absolutely love the addition of the Spark!  Calm also has music and gentle exercises. It has greatly improved my quality of life, and I am profoundly grateful for this wonderful resource."
267,2018-01-28 17:41:28,1,"The app itself is fine. But on the app’s page it specifically says “Supports Family Sharing: Up to six family members will be able to use this app with Family Sharing enabled.” 

So I paid 70 bucks for a subscription, since I and my son were both enjoying it. When I went to activate it in his phone, the app did not let me, stating that “Calm subscriptions are not eligible for Family Sharing,” because it is not allowed by Apple. 

This is hypothetically reasonable, of course, but makes it incredibly unethical to promote specifically as supporting Family Sharing. Of course, the free trial supports it, but who cares? The only value comes in a subscription, which I specifically bought because it explicitly said it supported it. This is an deeply deceptive practice that Apple should investigate and forbid. If it doesn't actually support Family Sharing in any meaningful way it should not be allowed to say it does. “App of the Year” indeed."
268,2020-08-06 06:33:18,5,"I haven’t had this app for a while. I haven’t even paid for the full app yet. (Sorry for any grammar mistakes, I’m tired but I felt an urge to write a review for this app).

I have anxiety, and that anxiety worsens as I look at the news, experience asthma that causes me to feel like I’m dying, and just 2020 in general. I’ve had insane family issues (but not as bad as terrible, terrible situations and I am grateful for that).

This app helped me get through that. I’ve been able to get better sleep by turning on a sound from a scene and just listening to it. I look forward to mood check ins. Those mood check ins help me feel relieved. It’s a place I feel like I can be totally honest. I used to lie a lot because of my anxiety, but I’ve been getting better at that because I’ve begun to see my issue as I exaggerate in these mood check ins.

I can’t wait to use the features it offers after you pay. It’s not that high of a price (70 a year) and I think it’s worth it if you struggle with anything. How to deal with anger, how to be happier in life, how to sleep, how to meditate, there’s so many interesting and cool things I’m just mind-blown."
269,2020-06-10 06:38:08,5,"This app has completely changed my life. Ever since I started using it, I now sleep all night without waking up once. Before I would wake up to battle with thoughts about the day ahead or past mistakes or even excited about the next day and wouldn’t get the rest I needed to face the day. Also the daily meditations have helped me stay focused at work when I need to and give me boost to finish my day without feeling overwhelmed and super tired. The more you practice the more mindful and present you become and this brings you a sense of peace, joy that I had never experienced before. If you are not sure wether to purchase or not, don’t think about it any more, give it a try you won’t regret it!"
270,2019-06-11 13:42:52,5,"It’s frustrating when apps claim to have a free version but then literally nothing is available for free. On this app, you literally get one story and one meditation unless you upgrade to the premium version which costs $70. Just list it as a subscription and not a free app. It would be so much more helpful if you could really check out the features of this app for more than 7 days without signing on for the subscription or being prompted to subscribe every time you touch anything. Sadly, this is an app I might really like and would consider paying for if it had a legitimate free version that I could try out for awhile without the false promise of a free version with no features and constant prompting/pressure to buy."
271,2020-06-03 18:18:17,5,"Applied to get this app to use as an educator in a middle school classroom. It was a constant in my room all year and into our distance learning time. We listened to meditations and music and sounds to calm and inspire. During our independent reading times I would project the fireplace image and sounds, other days the mountains and lake or a summer meadow. It became a fabulous part of our cultural. Now I have “breathing moments” during our Zoom classes. I share my screen and the students listen and watch. I truly appreciate the Calm app. I hope to continue using it in my classroom and encourage you to try it in your own. The students and I love it. (Their favorite was the Labron James’s series.) Thank you for this valuable resource!"
272,2019-06-04 23:06:09,4,"I have been using Calm since the summer of 2018, and it’s been a game changer for me in terms of dealing with anxiety, stress, and breathing. These past few months my sleep has severely suffered, and the white noise landscape has been a miracle for my sanity. I love the sleep stories but find that they are very short and so are more useful for me to listen to unwind prior to putting on a soundscape to lull me into sleep. I love the daily calm meditations though I wish there were newer meditations added a lil more frequently. Overall, Calm is like a crutch for my sanity. One aspect that has been getting progressively worse is the app crashing upon launching Calm from my phone. Recently I have to relaunch Calm four to five times before it launches properly. I really hope this improves as I’ve grown very fond of this app."
273,2019-05-21 21:46:16,5,"With gratitude I express not until my deep appreciation for this well developed app but also my appreciation for the spirit of the creators since that spirit is reflected in their work. Although there is no need for apps to meditate or relaxing, it is very impressive how much easier it is with the help of the sounds you created, the EXCELLENT narrator and meditation guide. 

Also, the other features such as music, story telling, etc. bring more joy and diversity to the tools of relaxing and being in spirit. This app makes a great impact because it guides you gently through the new experience of meditation if you are a beginner and if you are more experienced,  it adds to the joy of relaxing and meditation with their creative, well thought of, and diverse mental ambience creator."
274,2019-12-31 04:50:24,4,I downloaded this app because I recently have had a lot of anxiety issues and thought that this app would help me sleep better. I t was pretty good but there where not a whole lot of options if you did not subscribe or pay which I did not do. The ones that where free though where pretty good and helpful I just with that you did not have to pay. I have problems with this kind of stuff a lot when the it’s self is free to download but the content inside you can not use unless you pay and I don’t want to pay for an app that you can find the same stuff online for FREE. I also did not see that you had to pay for the stuff in the description. I just think that if your going to make someone pay make sure they know that they are going to have to.
275,2020-06-01 13:32:49,5,"Really love this app. The master classes are my favorite part. Very interesting and easy to listen too. Really wish they would make more of them. I have a year subscription and have listened to almost all of them (finally getting around to finish the rest) and some of them 3-5 times (gratitude, disproving happiness, rethinking depression, the 4 pillars of health and sleep are my favorite) would love to see some new ones. 

The only thing I would change in this app would be to ability to set the meditations like an alarm clock. They do have reminders but if I could set a meditation to start at a certain time I could do it without having to touch my phone (we all know how distracting phones are first thing in the morning)"
276,2019-03-11 10:23:33,3,"First off, this is such an amazing app - great job Calm! This app has morphed into a meditation and relaxation masterpiece. 

It’s missing a few features that keep it from being 5 stars for me, though. 

1) I’d like to be able to mix all sounds (both scenes and sleep sounds) with other apps (like you can with the apps White Noise and TaoMix). This would allow me to play sounds in the background whilst listening to an audio book for instance. 
 - It would also be nice to be able to mix sounds & scenes with Calm sleep stories. I find some of the stories too quiet and needing some extra background noise. 

2) If ever able to mix sounds with other apps it would be nice to control volume of the Calm app separately from the phone master volume (TaoMix has this feature currently). 

3) I’d like to be able to mix or overlap the sleep soundscapes for customer soundscapes. Oh, and more of the soundscapes, please, they’re great!

4) It’s time to morph the scenes and sleep soundscapes into one category. I love a couple of the scenes and would be so sad if they were removed (specifically rhythmic waves and gently flowing stream - I could sleep to those any day!), but the others are a little dated and could be replaced with the sleep soundscapes and more of those added"
277,2018-08-19 01:04:25,3,"This app has amazing, relaxing white noise to listen too, great night stories etc. but people who don’t pay $60 a year can’t listen to music or listen to most of the stories plus the week long meditations only have ONE day you can listen to for free. If apple wants more good reviews for this app they should have more choices for people who can’t or aren’t allowed to etc pay so much money for this app. It has so many cool features but it should be more accessible to everyone. I hope apple or whoever owns this app changes this for the better because many people who are depressed or anxious might not be able to pay that yearly money on top of everything else and they need to have this app to help so if that is changed this app would be five stars, because money isn’t everything, how people feel is 100x more important"
278,2021-02-22 20:02:10,3,"Ok don’t get me wrong I love this app in all but what really bothers me is that almost all everything in this app is locked because you have unlock calm and it costs money the reason why I don’t unlock calm is because my parents don’t know I go through stress,anxiety,depression so I don’t ask for the money for calm,It really bothers me that I can only listen to a few stories in calm I really think that you shouldn’t lock almost all of the stories,lullabies,songs,mediations you know all that stuff I really don’t wanna ask my parents for the money I know there is a 7 day free trial but the 7days will end soon and I don’t wanna pay for it, this is really helpful for stress anxiety and depression but a lot of the things in this app cost money but other than that this app is amazing and really helpful to the people who pay for it."
279,2020-04-22 19:02:08,2,"I recently saw the Calm app commercial on TV and decided to download it because it advertised itself as a “free app.” I tried the free trial for 1 week and I really enjoyed it. I got a lot of use out of the sleep stories. The Eva Green one is my favorite. 
Based on my free trial, I’m rating Calm 2 stars. My biggest issue is that it’s expensive. $70 a year and it doesn’t seem like there’s an option to pay it month by month. $70 upfront is a lot at anytime, but especially now since a lot of people are out of work. 
I also wish they offered a student plan option for a lesser price. College students are always stressed and I think this would be a great app to help them reduce stress without breaking the bank.
My final issue is that NOTHING is free. It’s free to download and create an account, but if you actually want to use the app and it’s features, you need to subscribe to premium."
280,2020-03-03 19:24:15,5,"I was constantly stressed, anxious and flustered. It hit me as I woke up in the morning and stayed with me all day, negatively impacting my daily life.
I was curious about meditation and the apparent (seemingly miraculous) benefits of practice.

It was difficult to find the time or patience to start so I knew a little guidance was needed.
I tried a few popular apps and Calm has by far stood out as the BEST guided meditation I’ve found anywhere.

You have a choice in guide, level of guidance and type of meditation. Help to get to or back to sleep, ambient music to sooth and even short stories read by some very familiar voices.

If you’re even a little curious I recommend downloading the app and trying the free trial.
It’s perfectly normal to be fidgety and frustrated with yourself at first, just don’t give up!
It’s difficult to describe the change you feel within yourself and everyone is different but I personally feel hopeful, energized and excited about the day ahead again.

I hope meditation can have a beneficial impact on your life too, even if it’s only to have a few moments to yourself now and then because you deserve it."
281,2020-01-27 02:30:49,5,"When I have a long day I find it hard to unwind and fall asleep, no matter how tired I am and I usually have night terrors that wake me up throughout the night.  Sleep is hard for me.  Sometimes even the fear of night terrors keeps me from falling asleep.

But this app has helped me so much.  It’s not like reading a book, because when I read I can’t help but read fast to find out as much as I can about the story, and it’s easy for my mind to wander while I’m reading.  It’s also not unusual for me to lose myself in a book and accidentally stay up much too late.  

The stories in this app are engaging, but the narrators usually read slowly, with drawn out pauses between sentences, which help ease my mind and allow me to relax and let go of worry.  They keep me grounded and in the moment.  Instead of letting fear or anxiety take over and drive my thoughts, the narrator is in the driver’s seat, and they are so calming.  I have yet to finish a story because they put me to sleep.  I also sleep through the night almost every time I use this app.

A dependable, good night’s rest is priceless, so the yearly cost of this app is very much worth it in my book."
282,2019-02-08 06:22:58,5,"I have been wanting to meditate for a very long time, but never really knew where to start or how to do it. One night I was having an anxiety attack and decided to try and find a meditation app. Calm came up and I decided to look into it. The first thing I saw was the bedtime story “Blue Gold.” The reader had the most calming voice and the story took my mind back to a trip I had taken to France. I was asleep before the story was finished. In fact, I fall asleep before most of the stories are over and I stay asleep longer. There are so many different offerings, including the meditation I had been wanting. There is limited access to the free portion, so I decided to purchase the yearly subscription, and I am so happy I did. Really worth trying."
283,2019-08-14 10:14:36,3,"I love parts of the app, but such an overwhelming number of your meditations are voiced by Tamara Levitt, and unfortunately I find her voice too cutesy or perky or something, for meditation. I can’t put my finger on the quality, I just know it’s distracting, making a huge number of your meditations unusable for me. I’d love to subscribe, as there are features I love, but it feels like enough of the app would be useless to me do to this issue, making the price point unjustifiable. What a shame you relied so heavily on one voice! I’ve had two other friends agree, sharing they opted out of your app for the same reason. Maybe others aren’t reporting back — I almost didn’t, but then I realized perhaps it would be useful feedback. Here’s hoping you increase the variety, so maybe I can rethink subscribing!"
284,2017-12-07 14:43:20,5,"I have tried many different meditation apps. There are six currently on my phone. This is the only one I ever made the leap to paid content. I like that there are so many different ways to use the app- the ""breathe"" part is super helpful when I just need to slow down my racing mind and/or ease an anxiety attack. I like that I can choose just silent meditation or guided. I like that there is a new meditation each day on a different topic. Some topics I like better than others but all in all, I find they give good food for thought for the day. I also enjoy the sleep stories. I still have never made it all the way to the end before falling asleep. (Although avoid the French ASMR one- that one just sounds a serial killer whispering in your ear!)"
285,2017-12-15 02:32:28,5,"This is a detailed, well organized app that’s high in content. There is a breathing section that you can customize for your own breath, you can customize your background and sounds that play. There are sleep stories that are constantly updating which I love plus there are so many to choose from and there are so many meditations to choose from, even driving meditations and ones for kids etc. You can even customize the voice to be louder than the music and vice versa. They thought of everything with this app. It’s extremely comprehensive and I never thought to spend that much before but after hearing a few sample sleep stories I now use it every night. Very impressive."
286,2020-06-29 00:41:47,1,"Perhaps I’m spoiled by Relax Melodies and Daily Yoga apps, but I feel extremely underwhelmed by Calm. Tamara’s voice is rather annoying and I can’t stand the format of the Daily Calm (it’s not calming, it’s irritating). The Daily Calm is constantly in your face and there is no way to make it disappear (I asked). Much of the audio is done by celebrities, celebrities that I genuinely don’t care about and don’t want to hear, which limits my options.

I tried listening to a Masterclass about Stoic Philosophy, it was clearly written by someone who doesn’t have a set schedule and is completely unrelatable to me. Just like every other “motivational” speaker I’ve heard, they only relate to people who work in marketing or similar departments and never relate to those of us that work set schedules, that already wake up early to go to work early, that work alone and have daily deadlines that aren’t flexible.

I had big hopes for this app, but I just find it irritating."
287,2019-11-20 03:24:09,3,"The app itself is everything. It has music, soundscapes, sleep aids, but the meditations have far too much talking in them. If you are looking to meditate, this app doesn't really give you that. But it does give you a lot (too much sometimes) of tools and information to frame your mind-space. I also don’t like the negative language, using phrases like “don’t...” and “ avoid...” or “try not to...” I already have enough of that going on in my head I just need to be told what to do, not what NOT to do, if that makes sense. Also her voice sounds staged and impersonal, it sounds like an audiobook-scripted voice. I don’t think that part would bother me so much if there wasn't so much rambling on that I get lost in the whole point which was to meditate! All in all, I appreciate the app but cannot say I’m getting any meditating out of it."
288,2019-08-08 03:58:04,2,"EVERYTHING IS PREMIUM! I don’t mean to be angered but some people need an app like that for stress and stuff but don’t have the money to pay 💰 💰 💰 💰 💰 cause I certainly don’t I know that’s not your prob and I get it but don’t you think having only like what? 4 things that are not premium gives people no choice but to buy premium. I mean there is a choice to buy premium for a reason but now it seems like I should get some other app that gives me a choice whether or not to have premium cause you have such a tiny amount of free things I really just get tired of doing the same things over and over and over again! So please at least if you try to improve with more free meditations and calming things cause not everyone has the money to buy premium, and I wasn’t going to buy premium but there is literally like nothing that’s free so... I guess I’m off to another app."
289,2019-07-15 01:35:45,3,"I was attempting to use the app and there is almost no content for me to use other than two sleep stories that are short and the one is a kids story. I wish there was like 5 or 6 free stories for me to use. I don’t want to pay $70 a year to use an app to help me sleep better. That is just too expensive for me and I don’t understand why. Why are people expected to pay $70 for help sleeping. I would like to use this app and its many features but I can’t do so without paying for it. One of the stories that is free is a moshi monster story and I feel as though that won’t help me fall asleep. I wish you didn’t have to pay for the stories. Maybe a free trial would work, I just can’t see myself or anyone else paying to listen to stories. I would love to use and support this app, but I can’t give a fair review without paying for it."
290,2021-01-20 12:17:38,5,"There should be a third category free, charge, and brief experience. Since it is probably is not your fault I gave 5 stars as the 3 free minutes I found before I deleted the app had great content. If there is more free time it took me too long to find it before feeling I was being taken because I had to give my private information before being given access to the 3 minutes I found. SUGGESTION: 1. clearly label the free stuff. 2. Give the free stuff away without having to jump thru a bunch of hoops. 3. Don’t give any free stuff away in this situation so the customer knows what they are truly getting. Most customers like me a used to a generous amount of free content such that they can make an informed decision Thanks"
291,2019-06-10 00:43:27,5,"I love this app and I cannot say that enough. I haven’t used many of the meditation aspects but the sleep stories alone are worth the subscription price. My anxiety loves to act up when I’m trying to fall asleep which means I can lay there awake for quite a while before I actually fall asleep. Listening to the sleep stories allows me to focus on something else and my anxiety fades away. A few of my favorites are “The shipping forecast”, “blue gold”, “the seventeenth princess”, and “starlight symphony.” There’s at least one new sleep story every week so you can try new ones but also rely on your favorites. There are also ASMR options for those who enjoy that. Thank you, Calm, for helping me get more sleep!"
292,2021-01-07 01:42:49,5,"This is the first review I’ve ever written on Apple. Never thought of it to be worth my time. This app, however, transcended my previous notIon of time and peace in the mind. After a stressful day at work, I have struggled coming home to my wife and baby girl with a positive attitude. When I’m in my car on the way home, I tune into Calm. Whether it be a relaxing piano melody, sounds of the rain forest, or listening to Lebron on how to train your mind to master emotions. I’ve also got into meditation and yoga for the end of my days because of this. My new found self-awareness and positivity has become evident to my family and has been profoundly beneficial. Thank you to the devs of this app, you have done a truly fantastic job. Namaste ✌️"
293,2020-09-29 11:44:29,5,"I’ve been using Calm daily for over 5 years and can say that it has genuinely helped me live a calmer, happier, more conscious life. For those things plus the Masterclasses and Sleep Stories, it’s more than worth the subscription cost. 

I can’t bring myself to take a star off for the interface, but it’s a real weak spot for new and returning users. Weird, unintuitive categories and long scrolls make it very difficult to find meditation sessions to fit the moment. I’ve even found myself getting frustrated and a little stressed out trying to find sessions other than my “favorites”! It’s a shame because all the content is so good... I just wish it was all easier to find."
294,2020-01-26 04:56:14,5,I had sepsis after some surgery and almost died. Over the next two years I suffered from terrible panic attacks to the point that I got very little sleep. I’m also a caregiver for my husband. He has  a rare cancer and his hands and feet are crippled so he is confined to a wheelchair. I don’t have much extra money but I bought Calm after trying it for a week. Listening to the Daily Calm helped to give me a feeling of peace and relaxation. I am also participating in the series on how to meditate. I look forward to the time I spend with Calm. I’ve been able to find joy again and I practice meditation because I feel constructive about the changes I’m experiencing. This is a truly life-affirming app.
295,2020-07-10 13:52:31,4,"I first have to say I do love this app a lot.  I love the stories, the meditations, and the music.  The only issue I have had, and it has happened several times, is that there are often times when the app will not load or is not available.  I tend to fall asleep quite easily however, I do not stay asleep.  This is usually when I will listen to stories or music on Calm.  This morning was a good example.  I woke up around 2am and the app would not load.  I tried turning my phone off and on.  I tried deleting and reinstalling the app and nothing worked.  So now I am not Calm I am annoyed and awake.  Is there something else I should be doing when this happens?  It appears to be working fine now.  This only seems to happen very early hours of the morning."
296,2019-11-14 04:02:19,5,"I’ve always found it hard to get to sleep. Recently, though, my anxiety got so bad that I was falling asleep two hours after I went to bed and waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning every night. I downloaded Calm, and the sleep stories helped me get to sleep in closer to 30 minutes. 

My only suggestion would be to allow users to create playlists. Right now, you can save stories you like, but they don’t automatically play one after the other. I understand that not all users would like this feature, but if it were an option that could be enabled and disabled, it would help me stay asleep on those nights when I just need a soothing voice in my ear."
297,2019-10-14 04:53:45,5,"Please helicopter me into the central office so I can shake each and every one of your hands.  This new phase of poetic bedtime-story mindfulness adventures is melting my heart, and my heart is muy cold sometimes.  I salute you, ye enchanting literary chosen people of wanderlust.  I want to marry you.  I don’t care if you’re a man or a woman or an operating system from the future, I want to merge with you in a religious ceremony.  One time I set myself on fire by accident and I saw the face God.  That experience was better than this one by a lot, but I can confidently say that the two experiences live in the same neighborhood.  God bless you, good people of the digital realm of calmness .  May your days be filled with the the light of the joy of our faces as we resonate this golden sounding life bell."
298,2021-01-06 04:37:32,3,"I might delete soon if I can’t figure out a way around listening to Tamara. This app is amazing in concept. Really great UI and I LOVE the sleep stories and the soothing voices of some of the actors that have made appearances on the app. But the way Tamara speaks GRINDS my gears and is so not soothing. Her phony upbeat cadence actually gives me anxiety and reminds me of a dog food commercial where they’re playing that whistling upbeat commercial tune. I know, I know... My review is very un-zen. But it’s because I just excitedly opened this app to get some much needed calming, and heard her very unmeditative voice. I should clarify that I’m not criticizing her actual voice — but rather the method of narration and cadence, which is overall too bright and energetic and phony. Frustrated and wanting to love this app more. 

Recommendation: Let us select the narrator for guided meditations!"
299,2021-02-11 03:29:28,2,"Most of what’s offered here isn’t traditional meditation. The focus is definitely on a lot of talking and guidance. The paid plan gives you access to a large number of sessions. But most of these are by one individual. The lack of variety is surprising, especially give the cost. Starting in Jan 2021, the offerings improved, but mostly more of the same. 

To make matters worse, the app supposedly tracks your sessions. Results are inconsistent, with some sessions not logged. There was briefly a display of a weekly goal, in addition to “streaks.” Now I’m on a new phone and that is gone? Why? A few months ago, sessions weren’t being logged if the app wasn’t open when the session ended. <sigh> Again, surprising shortcomings for the price and how long Calm had been around.

I got subscription through Amex, which is nice, but I won’t be renewing. That’s for sure."
300,2020-09-30 01:25:00,5,"I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. They say I have insomnia. I have problems with disassociation. The whole 9 yards. I’m also active duty army. They’ve fed me medication after medication to help me get to sleep and also stay asleep. I’ve been using this app for only a few days but I literally haven’t slept so good for as long as I can remember. It usually takes me around 4 hours to fall asleep. Now before sleep, I do a body scan meditation for 20 min then listen to a story. I’m out within an hour. Which sets me up to get 7-8 hours of sleep. My motivation and work ethics has returned. My anxiety and depression aren’t as noticeable. This app has opened my eyes to meditation. Something I laughed at throughout rehab and therapy."
301,2020-11-24 01:48:54,3,"I don’t understand. The app says it is free but then it says I have to pay freaking 70 dollars a year for this app. 
I am really bummed out with this app because i thought that i was going to be distressed and that i could listen to things such as the city or crickets to help me fall asleep. Or to sleep like a baby. But NOPE! If you even click on it it tells you to pay 70 dollars a year and that is stupid. I mean, it does help me with gratitude check ins and mood check ins but other than that i can’t listen to the sleep stories or music or asmr that they provide because it is locked. I hope that this will improve over time and that the developer of this app will make it a little more flexible because i am sure others are having this issue too and they just want to be cured of anxiety and depression (that’s me lol)"
302,2019-11-19 15:39:28,5,"By far the best meditation app on the market! I use it almost everyday. Calm has improved my sense of well-being more than any therapist I’ve seen, and taught me coping mechanisms that saved my life. I’m sure you’ve saved others as well. My favorite feature is Daily Calm and adding favorites, so I have a resource to help myself given a specific situation. Every time I listen to Daily Calm I’m blown away by the wisdom and amount of original content.  I want to give every member of the team a hug.

I read an article online saying Calm is valued at 1 billion dollars and won several awards. These are incredible milestone. You provide a service that ‘money can’t buy’.  I can’t thank your team enough."
303,2018-12-15 21:12:40,5,"I have been using Calm for about 4 months and Its so worth it to me. I started using Calm because I have always wanted to learn more about meditation. The Daily Calm (which is a meditation every day) made it so easy to bring meditation into my routine. And the difference it makes! I like to do the Daily Calm right before I head to work in the morning, as it helps me to set and carry out the intention to be mindful and present in my work day. 

Before I downloaded Calm I didn’t know that much about Sleep Stories, but they’re amazing! I usually don’t make it to the end of them, I fall asleep so fast. It’s a nice natural way to stop my mind from racing, helping me sleep. My whole life is better when I sleep better!"
304,2019-07-23 18:26:39,3,"This app is beautifully designed. And, what I could access for free was excellent quality. HOWEVER, apps are a very personal thing. You want to try it out and decide if it’s worth the subscription you’ll likely forget you’re paying for and to decide if it’s worth the space on your phone. 

The home screen has lock symbols all over it. That is many things, but not calming. It’s overmonetized, and that overshadows the intended experience. You should charge for quality, but when you lock down experiences and don’t encourage free (limited is fine to a point) exploration, you discourage use and invite churn. 

You might have great adoption with those less discerning. Who knows. If you’re “listening,” open up more experiences, and you might get more loyal customers who have money to spend."
305,2018-12-19 04:42:44,1,"This app appears to be a barely disguised way of forcing users to agree to having their private information collected for God only knows what use? If the creators are trying to be clever, this really misses the mark! Upon loading the app, one is asked to either agree to one of the most extensive privacy policy memorandums I’ve ever seen...or click on read more (the aforementioned privacy policy to choke a horse)! Once read you are directed back to the opening message where you can either agree to their policy or close the app. NO OPT OUT IS PROVIDED, as would be expected with any other similar application. I have deleted the app and unless the reader wants their privacy invaded, I’d suggest the same. What adds insult to injury is these people have the unbelievable temerity to request payment for a premium version. In other words, one pays to have their data spread out all over kingdom come! This is pure sh**!!"
306,2020-10-04 21:02:09,5,"These people don’t help you to calm down or relax in fact it’s just the opposite. I tried the temporary for free method and now oh and then I decided I didn’t want to use it so I canceled and that was a year and a half ago. I’m going through my phone today looking for things like a delay and all of a sudden I see that they’ve been charging me 1495 a month for a year and a half and I cannot for the life of me find out how in the world to get rid of it. These guysRaise my blood pressure 20 points. I am going to be on the warpath for this company until I get my money back and not until I get all of it back. Good luck if you decide to go with them, I would rather deal with honest companies.

307,2020-05-17 14:57:40,5,"It has always been a battle to put my eight year old stepdaughter to sleep each night. We have tried reading books, putting a movie on, warm showers before bed, etc and still she would be constantly out of her room making every excuse in the book to not go to sleep. It would typically take between an hour to an hour and a half for her to actually fall asleep from the time we put her to bed. I decided to download calm and give it a try...I played the first story on there for kids and just like that, she was out within 7 minutes!!! Now we use it every night when it’s bedtime and she is out like a light. I no longer dread bedtime, and she enjoys the stories! Win win!!"
308,2020-06-12 07:37:08,1,"Says the app is free, and then basically only shows you all the things you can’t listen to unless you pay. I’ve been listening to podcasts for years to fall asleep, so I was interested in the sleep stories. It took me forever to find the one thing I could listen to, and it wasn’t even half and hour long. Don’t most of us insomniacs hit that point where we know what we are listening to is running out of time, making it harder to relax? Sorry, but 20 minutes isn’t going to cut it. Trying not to be a cynic I started listening to what was offered and it was dry as toast. There has to be something for me to grab onto, or I’m just going to think about all the things that made me look for a sleep aid in the first place. It looks like they have good narrators, but I won’t know for sure because I don’t feel like paying $70 to find out if they have something worth the money."
309,2019-10-19 22:53:08,5,"I am a Special Education Teacher and I use this app not only with my students in the classroom but at home to calm myself from a busy day. 
The first time I played a story for the students there was not a sound in the room. The spinning and repetitive noises stopped. They thoroughly enjoyed the calmness and security the story and peacefulness provided. I use it every day after PE class to bring the children back into a space of calmness and ready to learn. 
I also use this app at home when I’m feeling anxious. I do yoga and mediate to the 7 days of anxiety. It has helped my mental state so much the last month. 
Thank you for allowing teachers to use this app free of charge. I use it every day and I cannot thank you enough."
310,2018-02-25 15:00:48,5,"Before this app, I used to meditate every now and then...mostly when I feel down and out, stressed, depressed...sort of like when most people pray; when they need something. A friend of mine introduced me to this app. Then I downloaded three other apps to compare. I liked that I could try out this app for 7 days before committing and I’ll be honest, $60 a year was something to think about. Through the 7 days I realized this app has gotten me to meditate every day. It definitely helps me to be more mindful of my emotions and responses to what life throws at me. So I decided to pay for the subscription. I look at it like a gym membership. It’s a necessity for me. It’s a good quality app. It won’t disappoint you. Namaste 🙏🏽"
311,2017-09-15 13:56:22,5,"This app is so great for those of us just starting to explore meditation and yoga. I love the guidance; the voice is so soothing and grounding. I have not paid for a subscription yet. I find that right now, I'm only able to practice sporadically, but as my intention grows, I'm so excited to invest the money so that I can explore the paid meditations. I also share this app with many of my counseling clients. With one of my clients dealing with severe anxiety, we start each therapy session with a meditation from this app. I always give her the option, and she always chooses to meditate. I highly recommend this app to a person looking to start meditating. I have a feeling that in the future I will highly recommend this app to seasoned meditators as well."
312,2020-03-23 17:22:44,5,"In these uncertain times it’s so important we remain clearheaded and focused. Ridding ourselves of the constant chatter is, by far, the best we can do for ourselves and those around us. “Calm Down” is not as easy as it seems. This app is an essential tool in keeping what’s really important and what is not, separated by simple breathing exercises with sounds of Nature. What relief it brings, especially the sound of the birds in the background. This is the best gift you can give yourself for the relief of stress, anxiety along with all the needless worry over what we cannot control but ourselves. I truly thank and appreciate the developers of this most important app and thank them for the relief it was brought to so many ❤️ Try it."
313,2020-10-22 16:35:15,3,"I did the trial and really liked the sleep story options so I went ahead with the purchase. Unfortunately the trial may not have been long enough for me to realize that most of the other content is unusable for me because of Tamara Levitt’s voice. Like many other reviewers I really can’t stand it. If you are looking into this app as an option for you for more mindfulness I’d recommend listening to one of her meditations just to make sure you jive with her voice. If not, she’s virtually impossible to avoid. I don’t really feel like I’m getting my money’s worth because of it. Also, it would be nice to have more ASMR options. The current offering are ok, but not totally in line with what I would consider ASMR. If the app developers are reading this, please consider “daily calm” options with different voices."
314,2020-09-03 18:44:17,4,"I LOVE this app. I have a lot of trouble sleeping due to anxiety and calm has helped so much. I usually fall asleep within five or ten minutes of a sleep story starting. I also really like how you can keep track of your moods and get recommendations for meditations based on what your mood is. The only reason I gave four stars was because I really think there should be an option to make a playlist or a repeat option of what stories, sounds, etc that you want to listen to. It’s really annoying for me to have to restart a story or choose a new one because I haven’t fallen asleep yet. That really wakes me up and stresses me out. Overall this is an amazing app that is totally worth the subscription cost and I have recommended it to many people."
315,2020-06-01 17:52:02,3,"I would use this app all the the time, but I don’t anymore. Why, well you have to pay for EVERYTHING, it is sooooooooo annoying and I absolutely hate it. See I have an iPod and I have to have permission to basically do anything, all I literally do I the daily check in. My parents won’t let me buy anything so basically this app is useless. Please try to make half the stuff free. That is all I’m asking. I 11 so my parents won’t let me do anything, they won’t buy much of anything. So all I am asking is to at least make half the app free. And no I won’t but calm premium. Don’t even try to make me buy anything because it won’t work. All I want is a perfect app that I can listen to to get some really sleep at night. I have really bad anxiety. Just consider making at least, at LEAST, half of the app free."
316,2019-12-28 03:18:27,5,"This is my second year using this app and I will likely purchase it again next year. However, the price does make me hesitate before buying. It is extremely expensive.

The app’s content, however, is incredible. The main lady’s voice is wonderful. Extremely soothing. Although I use the app how it should be used to meditate, I do also use it to go to sleep. I put the body scan session on when I’m lying down in bed and within 5 minutes I’m sound asleep. The whole app is incredibly soothing.

The health benefits have been fantastic. I just don’t dwell on things that make me anxious any more. Somehow, within a few months after using this app, I genuinely was able to just move on from things that once I would have ruminated over. This is something that I struggled to do for decades, yet Calm managed to get me to do it within a few months.

I am more able to live in the now and concentrate on what’s important. The app has helped me “tidy my mind” if you will. It’s helped me to prioritise, order, simplify and appreciate my life. I am honestly truly thankful for this app. My wallet, not so much😬"
317,2019-09-12 13:01:19,5,"I love the app. I really do. If you have trouble turning off the old brain at night, please try it. BUT to Calm: all the languages! I’m sure that’s a wonderful thing to increase your market. I totally get it. But can we have a setting to turn off being able to see the stories in languages that are not our native? It makes it sooo hard to go through the list. The worst is seeing a story being suggested or a new story (yay!) only to turn it on and it’s in another language (sometimes it’s hard to tell). Also, a sort by new stories or alpha would be awesome. I could listen to Erik Braa or Alan Sklar read the alphabet....Thanks!
PS - I will say, though, that an occasional story in French, which I don’t speak, will put me right out."
318,2019-04-26 04:26:20,3,"I absolutely love Calm, but because I'm not able to pay for a premium subscription, I can't play and music, listen to a lot of stories, and even don't have access to meditations. It's almost like the normal subscription is just a trial, and that you have to pay for the full service and material. By no means am I implying that there shouldn't be a premium, but those is us without the premium subscription can only access little sources. It would be nice if more was available, like the music. When Calm updated, it made all of the music premium. I used to love listening to the music to fall asleep, but now they've taken away that too. In simple words, I feel that more should be available if you have the normal subscription, otherwise, it's like you're just on a trial for be actual thing."
319,2020-08-04 05:24:40,3,"I first downloaded the app a few weeks after it was launched, many years ago. I remember playing the soft rain sounds and the voice-actress with the soothing voice telling me to breathe. I had the app for a couple years, and I just downloaded it again to see what’s new. Wow. There’s a lot new. It’s a lot of celebrities selling their persona businesses: Suze Orman, so you meditate on money; LeBron so you meditate on pro sports; Ellie Goulding and Harry Styles so you meditate on ... pop music? The list goes on with Disney and more. Mind you there’s nothing wrong with any of these personality businesses - just ... why are they teaching meditation, over actual Buddhist monks? People whose existence is about meditation. I don’t recognize this app anymore, but it has an exclusivity and isolationist vibe. 3 stars because you guys have a very pretty designed app, though."
320,2019-08-23 11:29:41,5,"First I have long suffered from insomnia- while I fall asleep immediately, I wake up in the middle of the night for an hour or so with my “head running” with thought. Historically I’ve listened to the radio but Calm’s sleep stories are much more effective at quieting my head and getting me back to sleep quickly. None more so than Henry Blofeld’s explanation of the Laws (not rules!) of Cricket. I have listened to him read those laws at least a dozen times and have yet to make it through the entire ~28 minute session once! His voice, accent and sense of humor are audio-Ambien. PLEASE have Henry read more content!

The guided sessions are superb at bringing mindfulness to the myriad realities and challenges of our lives and helping us address them in our own way. They unveil revelation. I am not embarrassed to say that from some of these revelations or the relief these sessions can bring, I have been “meditated to tears” on more than one occasion. 

Nothing to date has had the impact Calm has on my perspective on life, myself, my relationships with others and on dealing with life’s issues. 

I am truly grateful to have this."
321,2019-08-22 22:18:10,5,I feel like this app is really great to help you through some emotional issues but there are a lot of things that are locked. There’s a lot of trouble going to things that are locked because almost 99% of things there are locked there are a lot of things that locked sometimes you only have very few choices and sometimes you don’t have a choice at all because all of them are locked although I am glad that you do not have to unlock the premium for the home screen pages but I feel like there’s just too many things that are locked and they cut down on the locking to ask for premium and they might have added such a higher price.
322,2019-06-27 21:28:55,5,"Meditation is so not natural to me. Tried in the past, never worked. Saw an ad for Calm somewhere that struck a note w/ me and decided to give it a try for a week. Whatever it is about the Calm app actually works for me. My mind and body soak up those lovely ten minute sessions like a sponge. After a week I paid for the extended version and it’s probably the only app I don’t regret paying for. The short exercise sessions are great too. So happy I gave Calm a try after so many failed meditation attempts in the past. I just did a session, went into it heart literally racing—every time I think it’s not going to work, but it has. Try it. I’ve stuck with it for months now and I really love it."
323,2019-04-08 11:36:11,5,"I was going through a rough time personally with a relationship and this app helped me to slow things down, stand back from my thoughts and to re-evaluate my conduct and areas for improvement. It restored calm. 

The app is very well organized and a premium is placed on the quality of the content. There are bite sized sessions that are designed to keep you coming back everyday - it’s addictive.  There are also longer form sessions and master classes that allow you to delve more deeply into areas of interest. 

Tamara Levitt’s voice is pure velvet and the success of the app owes a lot to her input. This was the best investment in myself I have made in a long time. It literally changed my outlook on life and my place in it."
324,2018-01-31 20:07:21,5,"I have been using the Calm app for over 6 months now, and I don’t know how I lived without it!  Whenever I am feeling stressed, I can choose a meditation from their vast selection to alleviate the stress - and let’s be honest, we are living in a very stressful time.  I LOVE the sleep stories, which I use nightly to help me relax and ease into sleep.  There are so many to choose from and I have many favorites. It is such a luxury to have someone read me a story, using a calm, peaceful voice.  I am usually asleep before the story is finished, so I have to admit that I don’t know how most of them end!  I love this app so much that I signed up for a lifetime subscription - and it is worth every penny!  Try it - you won’t be disappointed."
325,2018-04-11 15:52:39,4,"This app is great! Beautiful content. I’ve only had it for one day but am loving everything it offers so far.

However, I’d like to report a major bug that is making the experience quite stressful. In the master classes, when I open the app after having navigated away from it to do something else, it starts playing audio automatically, and not only one track, but often two or three different audio files play at once. There is no pause button, so my phone is just shouting multiple audio tracks at once and I have to push play on something, anything, to add another audio track to the cacophony before I can then push pause, which somehow stops all tracks from playing and finally silences the app.

This also happens when going from one segment of a master class to the next. If you let it autoplay the next segment, it works fine. But if you click the play button to play the next segment, it immediately starts playing back the next segment twice (two audio files playing back at the same time but about 5 seconds apart).

Please fix these issues!

Thanks!"
326,2017-12-05 21:39:13,5,"I came to this app skeptical as a lot of people do. I kept an open mind and started poking at the various options... let’s face it, I need a little help everywhere. I dove in with the sleep stories due to very bad insomnia. Guess who didn’t make it through The Lavender Valley. This chick! I was excited and I dove more into the meditation. 

One session with the anxiety and I’m feeling a bit more at ease. I love it. I can’t wait to check the other options available for free. Even with a skeptical mind I went through the process and took it seriously and feel good for doing it. 

I wish it were cheaper to unlock everything, because I desperately want to, but sadly I lack the funds to do so currently but I absolutely think it can help whoever needs a breather to just sit back and bring them into the now and center the mind more. But they do offer a good variety of freebie sessions which are also super effective. 

Kudos to the developers and thank you for easing some of the things that are currently ruling and trying to ruin my life. I hope with more practice I can be a better person to myself and everyone else."
327,2020-11-04 06:45:39,5,"I have had so many problems with life just being life sometimes. It was going entirely too fast and far too often I began to forget to live in the RIGHT now and be present. It’s actually scary to think about because I was in my body at all times but I got so lost in my thoughts that I begin to wonder “who controlled me when I wasn’t “there” fully?” This is my first day using Calm and I’m thoroughly impressed off of the trial that I got when initially downloading the app. It is very late at night and you guys magically appeared in ad form on a social network that I was browsing at the time. I will be putting money into this app and recommending to everyone that I speak to. Again I say, thank you."
328,2020-04-22 22:35:18,5,"Calm is my favorite app at the moment. My sister and I listen to the sleep stories every night, and we love it! I am asleep in minutes, I don’t even know what happens at the end of half the stories I listen to. My father came in my room one night and thought the music I was listening to was very relaxing, and I agreed. (The music is also great) I bought Premium and it IS so worth it. You get access to EVERYTHING. I do the breathing exercises every day before school. It definitely calms your mind. Most of the narrators voices are very calming. Another thing is that every time you open the app it greets you with “Take a deep breath”. You can also change the backround which comes with calming music. Overall GREAT app."
329,2020-01-24 04:06:26,5,"I owe a LOT to the Calm app. I was struggling heavily with anxiety and depression issues, to the point where I couldn’t sleep or eat (I lost 5 pounds in like 3 days). I never thought I’d be able to get over it, but the Calm meditation classes have taught me so much that I never knew about my mind and body and gave me so much strength I didn’t know I had. Whenever I’m feeling tense I now know how to handle it, and I know how to fall asleep easily. The soundscapes are so peaceful, and I like that you can choose different ones or use the same one for all courses. I’ve definitely been recommending it to my friends who struggle with similar issues and I’m just really glad this came into my life when it did. Thank you Calm!"
330,2019-12-30 07:01:40,5,"This app is amazing. I live with Borderline Personality Disorder & a big part of living in recovery with it is emotion regulation. I cannot tell you the amount of times this app has helped me walk away & re-ground myself. I can easily step into my office & go thru a quick session without causing disruption to my work day. Just the other day I was having a very intense panic attack at a family Christmas party & I was able to go into a home office, sit down in a chair, & do a 10 minute grounding session followed by a 5 minute breathing session. I do the daily meditation every night before bed. The topics are SO relevant. I rarely purchase apps, let alone do a subscription, but I would recommend this to absolutely anyone."
331,2020-01-20 13:53:01,1,"I’ve encountered many issues with this app. The first is there is absolutely no possible way to use it without purchasing the year long subscription. They offer almost no stories or options that are free. Even if they did, there is no way to find them because the free ones aren’t shown at the top or in an easy to access place and the app doesn’t let you filter or search. Which is another issue-there are no good ways to filter or search. For example, trying to find all of the Daily Calm series is impossible. It would also be nice if you could queue the items. There are also features that have bugs in them. At one point the app switched from a night scene to a day scene when it was night to day in real life but it no longer does this. There are a lot of things this app could improve on and they really should do some user testing."
332,2020-11-12 15:20:08,5,"This is the app I can’t seem to live without no matter how stable my life seems to get (3 years and counting). My favorite features are listening to the scenes or the music, and of course the daily Calms. I love the sleep stories and Master Classes as well. I’ve listed to the mindful eating and pillars of health master class at least 3 times each now! I have recommended and gifted this to my mom as well as some of my friends. I’ve tried other meditation apps and this one seems to surpass them all in the user friendliness and quality (especially sound quality!). Highly recommend Calm to anyone looking for a great guided meditation app or someone to talk them to sleep at night :)"
333,2017-11-22 15:55:35,3,"First off, Tamara’s voice is so soothing! I have anxiety with random panic attacks, especially in the mornings. I find listening to the guided meditation really helps. Sometimes I listen while staring at the beautiful pictures provided and ‘trance out’. I would love to go further with this app but the charge to have all access is ridiculous. I just downloaded two more meditation apps to try because the free portion of this app is restricting me from going further. I really love this app and it does help me but I do not have the kind of money it takes to use this app fully. I did notice there are a lot of other apps out there and I would love to stay loyal to Calm but they charge too much and would create more stress in me trying to afford the app. Tamara has found her calling though-her voice is like mothers milk😁"
334,2020-08-28 01:34:35,5,"Every time I listen to the :15 or :30 commercials I just stop what I’m doing and focus on breathing - something I have to think about - exercising my breathing skills, because I have been told I do not breath enough!!! 
So, in the evenings I enjoy flipping through the catalog and finding the right energy and level of peaceful introspection to process my day and redirect any negativity or over stimulation of energy that could make it difficult to relax into a regenerating rest.
Yes , I do enjoy and look forward to Calm at the beginning, middle and end of the day and night.  It helps to go back to sleep and to wake up!!!
Thank you God for the gift of the people who developed the exceptional app/programming ✨"
335,2020-04-13 14:51:48,5,"If I could I would listen to this always. No more need for toxic noise, sound, and music in my life. When my son was born, I was reborn and this application is helping make that an easier transition in my life. I’m a Marine veteran of war and at 40 years of age my son was born with VSD. At that moment I was truly humbled. I come face to face with that man in the mirror and realized all the denial, the hurt, pain, suffering and more that I was dragging with me. That toxic behavior we all harbor and some more than others. I was on a path of self destruction and in denial. Healing is a journey of self discovery which takes the will and effort to do so. Today I use the calm application for myself and I share it with my family."
336,2020-05-14 07:50:25,4,"This is a good meditation app compared to its competitors. It definitely has a decent range of options to listen to from nature sounds to stories. However, for the price it does not have enough variety in each of these categories. There aren’t enough options so it can be easy to get bored after a couple months which, for the price you pay, isn’t really right. Also, there’s no search bar/tab so you can easily find what you want to listen to by title or reader and there’s no way to save what you enjoy to a playlist or saved tab. 

I’m not sure if I’d recommend this app to a friend because of this. It has the potential to be a really great app but I don’t know if it’s worth the price at the moment."
337,2019-10-15 16:04:45,5,"I applied for and received a free teacher yearly subscription to try out in my classroom. I am a K-5 music teacher who sees my younger students immediately after recess. That is a tough transition. I have been teaching for 13 years and have tried EVERYTHING to get my students ready to learn and sing as soon as they come in. I only see them once a week and my time with them is precious.  

This year I tried this app to use as a way to get my students in a mindset where they are ready and able to learn quickly. So far I have used the meditations meant for kids as well as several of the body ones. 

My students love it!!! I find that even though I am taking time out of instruction to implement this, I am getting the same amount of work done in less time and they are more focused during the instruction. 

I have also tried the chair stretching body movements for my older students who do a lot of testing - giving them a tool to use to get their blood flowing and muscles moving- all from their chair. I’m going to continue this for the school year and see what happens. 

So far I love it."
338,2020-02-01 11:41:35,1,"I’m disappointed that an app marketed towards people struggling with mental illness (anxiety, depression) costs so much. I had an ad for this app pop up so many times I finally caved and downloaded only to discover that the app literally has no free versions at all of these “calming” effects. I understand there’s a free trial, but sleep problems don’t go away after a week. If it “really works”, it really should be more accesible. It bothers me that we can download free pointless apps on our phone with a simple click, yet something that might actually better your mental health... costs more than my phone bill. I doubt I’ll be heard or listened to, but I wish this app would have at least a few of the features be free outside of the free trial... for people who can’t afford the asking price. All that being said, the reviews are great, so I’m glad others have found this useful; I just wish I could relate."
339,2019-09-16 13:24:48,3,"I really wish I could give this more stars, but something is really bugging me.  The sleep stories are fantastic and are worth the subscription cost all by themselves, but the guided meditations left a lot to be desired for me.  It’s not that Tamara Levitt has a bad voice — far from that — but I needed more guidance, more reminders to go back to my breath, some mantras or mental trickery here and there...by the time the Daily Calm subject is discussed, it’s too late because we’re asked to relax your attention before then.  For people like me who have trouble with their thoughts, that’s a problem, and it was only a couple of months before I felt I had to say goodbye to an app I thought I would keep forever.  That might change if the guidance improves, but for now I’m too disappointed to want to come back."
340,2018-07-14 19:05:58,5,"This app has made it easy for me to meditate regularly, and the guided meditations teach me how to become a better meditator! There are so many unique collections and sessions that there is always something new to try. The meditations have helped me in many ways I didn’t even expect! I’ve been using this app regularly for about six months, and I am much calmer and more at peace than I was before. Stressful situations don’t rile me up as much as they used to and I feel more present and ready to take on each moment. My sleep has improved significantly as well. I recommend this app to anyone that wants to experience the benefits of meditation but has trouble keeping up with the habit on their own!"
341,2019-01-04 22:57:56,2,"I cannot figure out whether you get anything at all when you download this app. It is very aggressive and insistent about buying “premium”, whatever that means. I cannot find any description of what you get for any of the 8 or so in-app purchases listed in the App Store or how to make any of those purchases. The only thing apparent was a free trial of “premium” but no indication of what is included.  I tried running one of the beginner exercises. It appeared to think it was running, but there was no sound.  This app is only for those who can afford to buy a pig in a poke for $60 as an experiment.  I.e., suckers. Beware also they insist on getting an email address and setting a password before you can even look around in the app.  Skip this thing if you want to know what you are getting before giving up personal information or buying."
342,2021-01-28 16:06:55,5,"This is going to sound extreme, but this app has changed my life. Not only have I been able to fall asleep without any stress, I actually feel lighter every day.  There are so many fun extras in this app as well! You can track how your feeling each day. You can write short gratitude lists, and even go for a deep thinking question.  I’ve had insomnia all my life.  I put on a sleep story and I’m out without worry or stress.  I tell everyone I know to get the app and subscribe!  My mother and I often joke about how long we can make it through a story.  Run don’t walk. Get this app and subscribe.   I would give this 100 stars if I could.  Bravo calm and thank you."
343,2018-06-07 05:59:46,3,"I’ve had this app for about a year now and I used to use it every day. I’m a college student, so it’s not always financially feasible for me to have the paid version of this app; which is why I really loved when they used to have a pay-by-the-month option. Now that they have gotten rid of that option, you can either pay $60 for one year or deal with the free version. 
With that said, I feel like more should be added to the free version, since listeners like myself may not be able to pay $60 upfront for an app. I love the sleep stories and would love if they unlocked just a few more than 4 stories for free-version listeners. 
Other than that small complaint, I still recommend this app to all of my friends with anxiety/insomnia issues or those that want to know more about meditation!"
344,2021-01-23 10:51:02,5,"I had to open up to it because I was anxious at first in general. You may know how that goes.. but wow. I’ve been benefiting so much. From the stories and meditations to the reflections and check ins. I could say a lot. But most importantly, I feel a: more relaxed and clear, and b: pleasantly surprised to know more about myself and feel growth. 
and the only reason I would be surprised at all is because I try to have an open mind when it comes to apps. This app is great. I would suggest the free trial and definitely experience it the full way through to see how you like it. I opened up to exploring more after a couple days. And I felt inspired to leave this review. Best."
345,2019-09-08 23:56:59,5,"This app is by far the best value I have found yet.  Nature sounds, sleep music, meditations, my favorite..sleep stories.  Fiction and non fiction.  Listen every night.  On a recent visit to visit grandchildren.  Very restless 3 year old even after bedtime reading and prayers she would lay awake talk and get up and just would not settle in peacefully for sleep.  I offered my Calm app and the kids section of sleep stories.  After family time of reading , etc, my daughter put on a kids sleep story and within 10 min granddaughter was sound asleep.  Used every night and every night she was out like a light. Granddaughter loves it my daughter is thrilled and loaded the premium app before I left.  Thank you Calm!"
346,2019-08-25 23:50:31,5,"I was thrilled to get a classroom subscription to Calm! I have two classes of bouncy first graders, many of whom come to school dealing with significant trauma in their lives. 

Afternoons are most difficult for my small kiddos. They come in from recess like little pinballs bouncing all over. Using Calm with them has made a huge impact on our afternoons. The kids are better able to focus and get back into learning. The kid friendly sessions are short enough for their wee attention spans, but long enough to help them settle their minds and bodies. 

For me, as an adult who struggles with anxiety, this has also made a big impact on me personally, helping me to slow down and settle my own busy mind."
347,2018-01-26 10:57:32,5,"This app has helped me so much! It has some amazing sessions for anxiety and general meditation,(Tamara’s breathing technique has changed my life) but the star of this app is the sleep stories. I’ve always struggled with anxiety with manifests in insomnia, and my mom would often tell me boring stories to help. This is that but I can have it on my schedule! It helps distract my mind which helps me sleep. 
My favorite is Stephen Fry’s lullabies. I mean who doesn’t want Stephen fry to read you to sleep?! His voice is so calming and comforting. I appreciate that he starts off by having the listeners breath before he starts the stories. 
I do recommend signing up for the paid plan. It’s a fantastic investment to better sleep and mental health."
348,2018-04-13 17:11:04,1,"I have been using this app for the past year consistently. I love it and it is/was my favorite meditation app. I have recommended it to more people than any other app probably. The meditations that I used it for were the body scan and the loving kindness. 

This morning I went to use it and saw that loving kindness is no longer free and requires the annual $60 subscription. I’m sorry but even if I used all of the features in the app I think that is pretty expensive. I understand a lot of work and effort goes into this app and that’s why it’s so great, but for someone like myself Who really only wants to use two of the meditations, why not offer an option to purchase access to those meditations specifically? I would pay a few dollars for each of those to have permanent access. Instead of getting some of my money you don’t get any now with the current model. Please consider different purchase options."
349,2018-01-01 14:14:00,5,"I love this app, especially using with my kids and students!! 
When I reviewed it originally 2 years ago, there were a few minor things missing...now they’ve gone above and beyond! Whether you use it with or without a subscription, it’s incredibly relaxing and recharging.  I am now hooked on several parts of the subscription which may keep me going with it...both several guided meditations for both myself and my kids/students, as well as the sleep stories. I also love the new added scenes AND as if from Christmas magic- the landscape mode now works on the iPad!!!!! :)
Cannot say enough good about this.
This is an amazing break and calming restart- morning, noon or night!"
350,2017-11-20 14:55:12,5,Calm is the best app I have! It has helped me in many ways. The guidance it’s provided as I seek to make meditation part of my daily life has been invaluable. The voice of the facilitator is soothing and the messages are positive and realistic. I appreciate the structure and the length of the sessions. They are short enough to make including a session each day very easy. Calm also provides a truly helpful section on sleep. The adult bedtime stories have helped me get back to sleep quite a few times. They are so effective that I almost never hear the whole story as I’ve gotten to sleep before it ends. I’ve recommended this app to all my family and many friends. I use some element of Calm every day.
351,2017-12-13 00:04:45,3,"I’m not looking for a meditation app at all. Sometimes I need commercial free background music to help me focus at work, but mostly I want calm stories to help me fall asleep. What I’ve sampled so far is good, but here are two things I would change. 1: put in a sleep timer so it turns off after a few minutes instead of running all night. Also, it should mark where it left off so you can go back there instead of having to start from the beginning over and over again. This programming exists, Podcasts has had it for years. 2: allow the a la carte purchase of stories and/or music (with a free short sampler). I don’t want to get socked for $12/month or $60/year for something that’s mostly ignorable and which I’ll probably run for a total of 1 hour per month."
352,2020-12-12 13:25:21,5,This app is underlaid with a perfect background blend of sounds from nature: non intrusive birdsong and stream sounds blend together to help you focus on being on your own island of peaceful harmony so you can relax and be mindful of the present moment you are experiencing rather than worrying about ongoing & future fears and dilemmas. The stories are wonderful from gifted voice actors and the daily calm (meditation) from Tamara is a fantastic way to begin your day feeling relaxed and positive. “Calm” is a true gift for anyone having a tough time with everything challenging this year of 2020 has brought to us all. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this place of sanity in these difficult times.
353,2020-06-18 05:09:42,5,"When I first found Calm, I was deep in throes of Complex PTSD. I had already been with an excellent therapist for a few years, but Calm helped me take my healing to a level of peace I never thought possible. I am able to manage my stress, acknowledge intrusive thoughts as just thoughts and not facts, and bring myself out anxiety attacks when they arise. 

As I have delved into the world of DBT, I have found many of the meditations and exercises on the app to be very much in like with the skills I am learning in therapy. 

One skill I am currently working on learning is progressive muscle relaxation. I have found the Deep Sleep Relax exercise to be very helpful at bedtime, and it would be so wonderful to have a similar exercise for day use, on the days when my anxiety can be difficult to manage. 

I do not exaggerate when I say this app saved my life. There was a time when my trauma was so overpowering it threatened my safety. The skills I have learned from this app have helped me to manage my trauma in such a way that I can live a life that is full of peace and purpose. Thank you so much, Tamara, for sharing your calling!"
354,2020-11-15 09:16:12,3,I am adryan green and I saw ads for your app many times and got very excited to try it but when I finally downloaded it I was disappointed to see that you had to pay to use it but then I saw that I could have one week free and i again I was super excited I was gonna get the most I could out of it for a week but I knew I had to be mindful of the deadline cause I can’t afford to pay it and we’ll here I am a week later and I was FOUR minutes late and now I have to pay 69$??!? I cant afford that if you could please please help me get a refund I would be ever so great full. You can counsel my subscription and everything I just really need the cash I have right now and can’t be spending 69$ on some app even if its one that has huge potential like this one.
355,2019-10-06 14:42:31,5,"I have to admit, I was very skeptical in the abilities of this app to assist me in falling asleep. I woke up around 1:00 am and as usual could not go back to sleep. I ended up turning to social media to pass the time until I fell asleep and came across an ad for this app. I figured “why not”. I downloaded the app, answered a few simple questions and started this story “Wonder” read by Matthew McConaughey. I listened for a while with my skeptical thoughts still passing though my mind until I actually fell asleep! I woke up again around 3:00 am and immediately turned to Calm and was asleep within a few minutes! I am so impressed! This is something I look forward to utilizing every day! Thank you!"
356,2019-03-24 13:46:30,5,"I love this app and am a lifetime access subscription holder.

I love statistics. I love capturing them, analyzing them, and (hopefully) using them to some good end. This is one of the amazing aspects of the iOS sphere of products!

However, because Calm disappoints and puts me in a awkward situation due to the fact it erroneously logs Sleep Stories as Mindfulness Minutes in HealthKit.

I do not want to throw off my daily Mindfulness Minutes by logging long Sleep Stories, so I must disabled HealthKit integration in Calm. This is the lesser of evils though as by not having HealthKit enabled in Calm, I do not capture actual Mindfulness Minutes metrics from actual Calm meditation sessions.

Having the ability to log mediation minutes to HealthKit but NOT Sleep Stories minutes would encourage me to become a better practitioner of meditation using Calm. I’d be capturing accurate data to help gauge my progress (or lack thereof) of my burgeoning meditation routine.

I put in a feature request for this ages ago and it never came to be, so I’m re-voicing the request here. I’m sure I’m not the only one with this quandary."
357,2018-11-11 05:25:22,5,"I have serious anxiety when it comes to hanging out with friends. I’ve always been the cool type of guy but always quite. Never knew what to say and what to think about. If my friends had a one-on-one talk with me, I would randomly sweat just because my head is all over the place, and I completely forget about what we were talking. I haven’t felt this way ever simply because it was a bad habit and I never knew truly what was right and wrong. I just turned 18 years of age, and I just had to break out and talk to my mom about it. Just last night she told me to download this app and i currently feel free and can’t wait to express it with my interest in subject conversations."
358,2018-05-04 11:42:18,5,"I started Calm on the recommendation from a friend.  I used the free version to start.  At bath time I relaxed to the various download themes for waves, mountain sounds, rain/ storm sounds, and such.  I closed my eyes and could feel the tension melt away.  I opted for doing a yearly membership to open up the sleep stories when they offered a discount.  

I find myself using the sleep stories to turn off my racing mind and to fall asleep quicker.  The ones I favor most I download to play offline.

This is a wonderful app if you want to decompress after a stressful day.  I would give it 5 stars if it was more affordable.  I wouldn’t have opted for the yearly subscription if it weren’t for the discounted offer."
359,2018-05-20 08:37:05,4,I bought the subscription last year for myself.   It seemed similar to other items I purchased except the app has everything in one location which is nice.  I was thinking of just buying similar audio versions of the techniques I enjoy and creating a playlist so I would need to worry what happens after my subscription ends.  The only problem is my 7 year old has me play calm for her as she falls asleep each night.  There are certain songs she likes.  I think if the price was lower for repeat customers I would just automatically renew each year.  I am just not sure the benefits outweighs the cost with this app.  I do recommend trying it.  I have enjoyed it this past year.
360,2017-09-08 15:27:42,5,"I reach for Calm every day. I wake up with the Daily Calm 10-minute guided meditation and my kids love to listen to sleep stories at night or when they want to chill. As a psychologist, I not only recommend this app, but use it during sessions with clients. The Breathing guide is great for teaching all ages, the Meditative sounds are relaxing, and ability to monitor your practice is appealing to teens and adults. I also appreciated having a very usable version free of cost which makes it easy to try first. I have purchased a yearly plan as I think it's so versatile and streamlined to fit into my day. Love the ever-evolving and additive content. It just keeps getting better!  Thank you Calm!"
361,2021-01-09 16:18:32,5,"This app has changed my life in so many ways. I now wake up earlier and happier.  I am a better mother Bc I have more patience and a better understanding of my boy. I have a better relationship with my bf Bc I am more tolerant, calmer, and level headed. Tamaras voice is so calming and her messages are so inspirational that I find myself wanting to listen to her all the time. It has improved the amount I drink and WHY I drink and I have nearly quit smoking. I have begun to work out and WANT to work now. I’m so much more down to earth and chill. I am so happy I found this app. I told a friend about it.... I saw him a year later and he said it changed his life as well!!!!  I cannot recommend this enough. I love it"
362,2020-08-10 14:46:21,5,"I recently went through a difficult time. I had a severe case of shingles brought on by stress. The illness was a physical manifestation of my internal stress. It was a wake up call for me. When I think about the damage that I have done to my body, it makes me very sad. I knew that I had to do a better job managing my stress. A friend had recommended the Calm app to me previously but I had not taken advantage of it. After getting out of the hospital, I started using this app to meditate and be mindful. It is easy to use and is helpful in my goal to take of myself mentally. There are lot of different listening options and I feel like I am going to be able to improve my stress management."
363,2020-07-21 14:32:25,5,"I’m not gonna write a really long review about how this app changed my life because there are tons here that already describe exactly what I would say.
Also to ppl complaining—it does NOT NEED TO BE $70 a year!!!
After you signed up for a free trial, go to your subscriptions in your app store, and there are multiple subscription options. I pay $40 a year. More than worth it for something i use daily, with constant new content. (Tbh Id pay $70 too) 

My entire family uses this app every single day. I wake up with my daily calm, and my daughter & I both go to sleep to the sleep stories and have the rain storm sounds going all night.
I have tried many meditation apps before this and none of them clicked. Everybody has a different style or need for meditation, and since I am ADHD, The typical “just sit there and let your mind go blank” apps never worked for me. I need guided meditation to stay focused and well… For guidance. I swear, Tamara is a wizard, because the daily calm’s always seem to apply to exactly what I need to hear.  
Ill be a Lifelong paid membership for sure!! 💕"
364,2019-11-03 11:02:41,5,"I am not one easily swayed by tv ads, no matter what the merchandise or product; Ever!  But there was truly something about just the mention of the word alone had it’s own impact ~ C A L M and my body ~ I began to relax.

CALM being set against a  backdrop of a  beautiful & simply melodic chorus of steady streams from Heaven’s own very eyes.  The downpour races endlessly over the most luscious of greens  rooted in vibrant vines ~  destined to produce only “fruits of the vine!” 

Now that I’ve downloaded app and learned my way through, I can sincerely say that I AM SOOO ENJOYING MY  “CALM” EXPERIENCE!  No one is paying for my patronage & there is certainly no one paying me for endorsement!!!  I find this app pretty easy to navigate through."
365,2020-03-10 21:37:35,3,"This app is actually pretty helpful and good for personal growth. I had one complaint with it though. It is one of those apps that is constantly bringing up the premium option. I didn't want to purchase premium because it was a bit too expense for  me. But I downloaded the app because it included sleep sounds and I needed that because I had been looking for sleep sound apps and not many I tried were good. This one seemed like the real deal to me. But you have to search and search to find a music or a sleep sound that's not premium and usually the not premium ones aren't all that good. Now I know that the point of premium is to include the better features, but I don't think all that searching for a mediocre sleep sound that's not premium isn't worth it."
366,2018-07-30 14:35:29,5,"I have depression with anxiety. This Calm app with Tamara has changed my daily attitude. I even purchased an aromatherapy machine to add to the dimensions I get from this miraculous app. I feel like a child being tucked in at night for a bedtime story which I look forward to to each evening. They put me to sleep every night without fail. My sleeping pills do not really work for me however, now with Calm I am unafraid of the tossing and turning of insomnia! Finally, a beautifully and thoughtfully designed app that takes me to a world of peace. If everyone were to use this app on earth it would be a very different place. Many thanks for the detailed healing approach that you place in this award winning app."
367,2019-10-04 03:56:27,4,"My 10 year old daughter has separation anxiety at night and listening to these sleep stories has dramatically helped her to fall asleep on her own. However, we’ve gone through all of the stories that she likes (her preference is driven by both the sound of the voices and the story line) and she isn’t one to listen to the same story over and over each night. Content is not added as frequently as it should be, and she complains that the voices with accents are hard to understand. We will continue to try this one out as we’ve tried other similar apps and she says those are boring compared to Calm, but I really hope they consider added more/new kids sleep stories."
368,2017-08-29 17:51:11,5,I absolutely loved this App! I tried making meditation a daily habit with 2 previous Apps! They were great Apps but I was not successful using them. Then I saw Calm in a suggested post on Facebook and I tried it! Wow! I fell in love with the feature of keep a daily record and the Sleep stories!  Soon I was meditating daily! I have meditating now for a whopping total of 112 days! Meditation has now become not just a habit but a lifestyle! I love listening to Tamara daily and the best part of my day is listening to the Sleep Stories at night! My sleep quality as well as quantity has improved so much! Thank you for this amazing App! I also love the improvement that your team continues to do to make it even better!
369,2018-06-26 01:47:23,1,"ETA (in response to developer comment): What I mean is that the program called ""7 days of calm"" showed as being unlocked in the free version, so I assumed the whole 7 day program was unlocked. However it was just the first day of the program. You get none of the programs for free. Only first days. You can't truly try the programs without a subscription. 
****
Since the 7 days of calm was unlocked without a subscription, I assumed I got the whole 7 days worth to try it out. But nope, you only get 1 day. The only way to really try it is to do the 7 day free trial which will roll over into a full year’s subscription unless you cancel it. I can’t take a $60 plunge on such a limited trial. 

Also, I found the speaker’s voice a little annoying. While using earbuds, I could hear all the noises her mouth made while she spoke, which was distracting, to say the least."
370,2020-08-29 14:39:36,5,"You’ll never run out of content with this app, and it has something for everything. Beginners, intermediate, and people experienced in meditation and mindfulness will all find something for them. There are guided sessions, less guidance, breathing exercises, stretches and motion exercises, music, sleep stories, check-ins, and more. 

I have used this app extensively in conjunction with therapy for depression and anxiety, and it has lined up perfectly with what I’ve needed. It’s helping me learn to manage both mental illnesses, and mirrors what my therapist says in regards to self-love, cognitive distortions, mindfulness, and more. 

I love 99% of this app. The ONLY thing I wish were different is a way to mark off meditation sessions you’ve done before. This is done only in the sessions that have to be unlocked before continuing in a series. Sometimes I forget what sessions I’ve completed. You’re able to favorite a session, but no other marking is provided, as far as I’ve been able to tell. 

Highly recommend this app! As cliche as it is to say, there really is something for everyone on it."
371,2020-01-04 05:45:27,5,"I use the FREE version. This app has a handful of features that you can shortcut with Siri. I have ptsd. I am an Army Veteran. So stuck in traffic at a stand still or waiting at a doctors office is a great place to ask Siri to “open my breathe bubble “ for a 3 min or a 5 min emergency session. I have also plugged my phone into my ya and done the breath bubble. Changes my heart rate almost every time and then that changes my body’s fight or flight response overall. You can even close your eyes and listen for the sound change to breathe in or out but it appears most effective with the visual input. Tomorrow, I am using the Siri short cut to use my breath bubble before I put the car in drive."
372,2019-09-15 15:10:24,5,"I have told every person I know who is struggling with stress, depression, anxiety and so on, about this app because it has completely altered my way of thinking for the better. I look forward to meditating because Tamara Leavitt is absolutely amazing. I’m speechless when it comes to conveying the imprint this app had has on my mental health. You will feel refreshed, at ease and like a new person once you have challenged yourself to the meditating journeys. Luckily, that is just ONE of the many perks of this app too. There is everything for anything on this app. If you are struggling, do yourself a favor and purchase this. You will understand right away why this is that amazing."
373,2019-09-02 01:14:27,5,"This app is simply the most amazing app I have ever downloaded! You see, I have been going through lots of family issues, but let’s not get into that. The thing is, this app has helped me find my inner...well...calm. Every night, I can’t sleep and I go into this app and I slowly fall asleep almost instantly. My favorite one is the “7 days of Calm” one. I am only on day 1, and I already am in love with it! I think it’s amazing that such a simple app can cure all this stress that lots of us have. I had such a hard time focusing on my exams at school, I got no sleep, I was always sad about my family, but this has truly cured me! Again, this app is truly the best! Keep calm, and play Calm!
😴❤️🙏🏼🧘🏼‍♀️"
374,2020-11-20 15:19:02,5,An amazing app truly helps unwind and learn to be in the moment. I am someone who of recent years have been troubled with mental health issues and this app at times has helped cope with those issues. Some days are harder than others and sometimes I forget to use this wonderful app on a daily basis. I am going to try and continue to get on a daily regiment of mediation. I just want to tell you guys thank you and god bless you because society still doesn’t seem to speak much on mental health as they should and you guys are truly doing a great job to help people overcome their issues if not at least maintain stability. So from the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you!
375,2019-04-16 03:01:19,3,"I have had this app for a couple years now and really enjoyed the free content that was available. I especially enjoyed the 7 days sessions and the handful of single available meditations (my favorite was “loving kindness”). I listened to a meditation almost everyday before bed. 
However within the past year or so, this app has updated and restricted what is available without a subscription. While I do love the content and understand the need for a premium subscription to help fund it, I am a college student and cannot afford extra expenses. I wish that slightly more content would be available without a subscription, like as before. Or at least provide an option, like another commenter suggested, to filter out free vs premium content."
376,2018-02-25 05:07:04,4,"Without going into much detail, I have been suffering from anxiety and an overwhelming amount of stress lately. I was recommended this app and so far, it has been helping me a ton. It reminds me to calm down, and then teaches me how to remind myself to calm down. The downside is that most of the app is blocked by a paywall. I will probably give in and pay for the subscription, but come on! There is probably people out there who really need this app, but can’t afford it! If you are willing to pay for the subscription, then you will absolutely love this app. It’s not just for people with anxiety either. Mindfulness is a skill that anyone could use in their daily lives, and this app teaches that skill perfectly."
377,2017-10-23 03:11:34,2,"Overall I really like this app. The breathing, the meditation and the sleep stories are all wonderful. I've used the sleep stories to help me get a great night's sleep for the past month and a half. The only negative I have is the price to upgrade. $13 a month, $60 a year, $300 for the lifetime option?!?! That's way too much for me!! There is NO WAY I can justify spending $300 on an app. I wish they would give the option to buy individual sleep stories, but that isn't the case. So for now, it's the free version for me. I hope they will revisit the cost, but I'm not counting on it.  
ETA: since the makers of this app still have outrageous prices and have decided to keep free content at a minimum, I’ve uninstalled the app. Kind of a shame, hope they enjoy their money, as helping people for a reasonable cost doesn’t seem to be their priority."
378,2017-08-23 03:45:41,4,"I haven't had a long t of success with my meditation practice this last year. I could manage the ten minutes or whatever, but so much would be going on in my mind I would actually feel more stressed at the end of a session than at the beginning. But the Calm app might help me with this. So far I love the breathing program because it calms my whole nervous system & helps me go to sleep. This is great because I have terrible insomnia and I would prefer to take less sleep medication. I am in the middle of the 7 days of calm program and having a guided meditation is also helpful. It makes it easier to stand apart from the crazed weasel of my thoughts and not get as caught up in it. I am curious to see if the good results continue."
379,2020-10-10 20:03:40,4,"I got this app impulsively and also while I was going through a very dark and rough part of my life. I was skeptical about it, but thought no harm could come of giving it a go. At first I thought it was not really that useful since I wasn’t really trying during the trial run. I forgot about canceling my trial, and that made me commit to actually using the app. Once I committed to regularly using the service, it helped me relax, unwind, and have a go to toolbox for settling my anxiety. Learning how to meditate has been highly useful. The app has a smorgasbord of tools, tracking mechanisms, and resources for the users. I think that it’d be interesting if there were features that could allow for group meditations, but that’s just an idea."
380,2019-12-05 01:58:51,5,It is amazing  when you feel sad it tells you story’s at night or when every time you want or calming sounds that are really calming sometimes I feel sad but when I try this app I feel happy there are other apps that I have and it works too but I like this one better they are called smiling mind headspace and a other one that is called calming too so try it so when you feel sad you feel happy again so go know and get this app so it makes you happy and me and ever one happy so go go go and be happy like you want to be because you can’t live sad you have to live happy so get happy so you can be happy and happier so you don’t sad  it works so go be happy like I am
381,2020-05-12 03:12:39,3,"I used to love this app and now the ones that I fell in love with all of a sudden became unavailable. I’m not sure what happened. I do not have a premium subscription. I feel like in a time like this we all need a little help with sleep and comfort. Some type of normalcy and it was taken away. I am frustrated.

Update... since they’ve changed it a couple months again they’ve done it again. I got use to the voice of someone new and now they’ve taken that one down. I’m a very scheduled person and to keep having it taken away when I was so happy with it before is upsetting. I’ve used it for over a year and now there is very little that is “free”. I’m guessing it will eventually no longer have anything accessible (free) for people who really need it that can’t afford it. Saddened."
382,2019-10-22 03:49:52,5,"I just got this app today.I am not paying, because my family is not rich and I’m a kid. :p So, I kept seeing boring apps saying “Do nothing for 15 minutes....” I never did it. I finally thought “Ugh, I’ll install it....”, and I’m glad I did. I am in 4th grade, so I have big tests and studying, then after school, I have to Clean my room, sometimes make my bed, Change out of my uniform, etc. It’s very stressful having so much to do. Then I thought of the Calm ads. I stumbled blindly into the app, I thought it would be lame. NO. It’s great. I like the breath bubble a lot so far. It calms me down after an exhausting day of school. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️, no doubt. I recommend this app, thank you for reading. Have a good day! :)"
383,2019-09-14 19:22:41,5,"It’s incredible the impact that being in control of your own mind can have in your life. This app has helped in so many ways, not just in practicing mediation as a daily habit, but also in attaining peace and quiet. The daily practice allows me to be more disciplined. Meditation is a habit that can have a spark reaction, bringing into your life more healthy and positive habits, derived from a disciplined mind. I love the sleep stories, and the catalog of music and soundscapes. The content is continuously being updated, and I find the app’s UI very beautiful and friendly (as an iOS developer). Overall, I highly recommend this app which will provide you with real and meaningful value."
384,2018-05-11 04:59:02,5,"I have found this app to be professionally done and very calming. After reading books about meditation I still needed something to provide a guide to actually meditating. This app provides many guided meditation sessions. There is nothing gimmicky about the sessions. Her voice is calm, confident, soft and reassuring. After a few sessions I felt like, ok, I'm meditating. It's not magic. It's practice. I'm married, have a great family, great friends, exercise every day and now I take ten minutes or so to listen to Calm and meditate. It's good. 
Everything I said above continues to be true. It is not magic but there are days when the insights expressed in the daily calm seem to be so pertinent and so personal that it comes close."
385,2019-04-03 05:27:47,1,"$70 A YEAR IS UNACCEPTABLE!
 for the lack of almost any free features in this app. I bet they are all amazing but I don’t subscribe to these things cause I don’t have the money so I’m just screwed?! I CAN’T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE MEMBERSHIP!? This is just plain and simple, the people are telling me by not giving me a quality free app, with things to do and they  LOCK everything behind a paywall! that they say “pay $70 a year and you may use it” but NO that’s not okay! The message that I receive when not using the membership is 
“F**K YOU GIVE ME MONEY” I went in and thought I could just listen to a bedtime story but NO! Another thing is this look at it this way.. “oh you wanna improve your anxiety and lower it? TOO BAD GIVE ME $70! Then you can reduce your anxiety” seriously that’s what this is. I heard I could do that for FREE and I WAS LIED TO. In short stop giving this 5 stars, 4 stars it doesn’t deserve it. WHERE IS THE HONESTY!?"
386,2020-07-09 10:13:52,5,"I signed up for Calm to help me during this time of pandemic to shut down my brain.  I am an American Black woman and the news each day about the inequities and assault on Black people .you would think the whole world is suffering and yet Black Americans have experienced trauma ...whether it be death by Covid 19, death by police, death by whites for just jogging, and toxic words from the leader of this country.   Calm has a sleep function..that helps to rest my mind when I need to sleep.   (I don’t really know who designed Calm and just pray that those that did care that about all people.   I hope as more meditations are designed that the voices represent a people’s and dialects from around the globe.)"
387,2018-01-10 07:15:04,3,"The ad on Facebook was a little 15 sec countdown. Seemed great. I wanted a soothing little countdown on tap so I downloaded the app. I open it and the first thing is that it wants me to creat an account or login with Facebook. I shouldn’t need an account to do a little breathing thing, take me to the breathing thing. Now it wants me to buy packages. Next it gives you a whole long list of options without clear info on what is what, so just like all of the cluttered online stuff I see all day, I am now wading though things that I have to click on. I find a breathing thing— perfect. I take one breath, hold it, relea...a pop up appears. The app is like if Buzzfeed tried to get into the meditation field. Three stars for the one nice breath I got to take, and for their nice Facebook ads."
388,2021-01-06 18:50:04,4,"I really enjoy the simplicity and various aspects of the app when it ranges from beginner meditation, daily meditation, sound scapes or even music. The easy access on my phone makes it a little easier to make meditation a habit. 

Honestly I gave it 4 stars because I wish there were more options for the self check ins. I’m not just tired I’m exhausted. I’m not angry I’m aggravated, annoyed or frustrated. I’m not unsure but I can be melancholy. It’d be nice to have more accurate progress checks, self check ins or reflections. Especially since I signed up for the premium. Also I wish there was more spiritual guided meditations, reaching a higher self or working on strengthening your intuition. It’s nice to work with those from time to time."
389,2020-03-08 00:49:07,5,So I met a guy that I loved but he started to ask me for nudes on FaceTime and I felt rly nervous and he kept trying to make me feel comfortable but I just felt like I wasn’t ready. It was like peer pressure for me because I had never done something like that before so I was scared in a way. But then I went on calm to just see if it would work and I was starting to think it wasn’t working the first 5 minutes in the meditation video but after I kept listening and following directions it really helped me and before my hands were shaky and I felt dirty but after watching the video I felt more natural and better so I rly do recommend getting this app it helped me so it may help u too!
390,2018-03-20 14:12:04,5,"Getting outside of your head isn’t easy to do when you’re bi-polar or depressed or just in a general funk. I’ve found that the calm app has helped me in regulating and redirecting my manic thoughts. 
This app really does help, you just need take the time to let it. Even if you can’t sit still to do it, at least focus on your breath and if you can close your eyes.
I’ve found that in the morning when I’m running or on a bike, w/e, it’s just as easy to open this app as it is to listen to some heart pumping music. I honestly prefer this to my music now and find that my workouts are more effective because instead of focusing on the pain I’m focusing on Tamara’s calming instructions.

THANKS CALM APP PEOPLE!"
391,2019-04-13 12:44:15,4,"I appreciate all of the relaxing and de-stressing sounds Calm gives for free, and although Calm has to make money to keep this wonderful app going, I wish they could afford to give everyone access to the entire app for free. Their prices are very reasonable but for some even the lowest prices just aren’t attainable and so they’re limited to tools like learning how to meditate properly, learning how to get to that peaceful place when their surroundings are in chaos, learning and practicing with experienced professionals who can help them find a way to de-stress and get to their “Calm”ing state of mind. I do love this app and I hope for many current and future blessings for everyone involved in creating a place people can go for a little or a lot of peace! 💛💜❤️💚💙🧡"
392,2019-01-30 21:09:58,2,"I really liked this app and used the Lavender Valley sleep story all the time, but had to take a break from the Calm app for a little while, only to come back and find that I had to get Calm “Premium” to use it again. I for one think that meditation should be free for anyone to use and you should not have to pay. I understand that you have to make money, but at least don’t change what is free and what’s not. Also, I think that you should make it so you can buy each individual also sleep story, meditating, class, song, and anything else for like a dollar a piece. I think that would make more sense, be more convenient for the users, and still make you money. Please take the time to consider my review, and please do something about the expressiveness of this app. Thank you."
393,2017-09-02 14:13:08,5,"After looking into guided meditation classes where I live, I found this app. Compare paying $59/ year & being able to do it 24/7 wherever I am...  to paying $10-$15/ each class that I would have to travel to was no contest. 

A review below negatively complained about having to pay for the app!? That's ridiculous. Not only is the app well worth it, how can you put a pricetag on your happiness & mental well being?? A lot of time, energy & money goes into producing apps so to expect one (especially one as great as this one!) to be free is fairly self righteous. 

This app is absolutely amazing & has changed my life in too many ways to count. I would recommend it for everyone!!"
394,2020-10-12 04:50:01,5,"I got a Complementary 1 year subscription to Calm Premium through American Express, I haven’t heard of this app before but let me tell you the quality of this app is amazing! I listened to one Of the sleep stories last night about Jazz and within about 5 minutes I was sound asleep. Through these trying times stress can make it difficult to fall asleep so it’s great to have options like these so you don’t have to take medication to fall asleep. Thank you so much Calm for making such a wonderful app. I cant wait to listen to another sleep story tonight and try the other features of the app. And Thank You American Express for your Generosity."
395,2020-10-21 20:21:41,3,"This app got me started with meditation. I found Jeff’s intro course really helpful and wish he did more than just the intro course. The Daily Calm meditations are hit or miss, however, and I find Tamara’s arrogant manner and style distractingly grating. The new Spark series is more lecture than a meditation, but has interesting topics. Some of the sleep stories are helpful and I find I strongly prefer the non fiction ones with calming male voices. I’ve been awakened jarringly by a female narrator whispering creepily, and they each follow their own formats, so I definitely stick with the ones that work for me. You’ll likely find your favorites too. I’ve researched and found a similar app with more varied features and with more focus on content and less focus on flash and celebrities, and they cost the same, so I won’t renew."
396,2020-07-09 15:47:24,5,"This has been a very stressful year for me and I have by the grace of God found my way back to recovery.  I was looking for something to add to my toolbox and meditation was something that was valuable to me in recovery before but I have struggled to get back into the practice.  Calm has been just what I needed.  This is my 3rd day of meditation with the app and last night I feel asleep without racing anxiety as I listened to the first bed time story.  I am a licensed professional counselor and would recommend this app to anyone, new to meditation, someone seasoned and has gotten out of practice or someone who is looking to add to their already existing practice."
397,2020-05-17 05:22:57,5,"I’ve been meditating since 1975, but I haven’t experienced anything like this. There is so much in this app that I can’t do it justice in a short review. All I can say is go for the 7-day trial and explore the entire sight. There’s more here than just breathing exercises. I will let you know that the yearly subscription is about $70, (and I was just a little curious after watching the TV commercials), but for that price you get a tremendous amount of resources, including meditation, music, stories, ambient sounds, and on and on. Please, please trust me on this—spend the money and get this app. These are good people associated with this program...you won’t be disappointed. Try the 7-day trial and be amazed."
398,2020-01-05 04:25:10,3,"I like this app, I put it on at night and listen to the free stuff, but that’s the thing. Just the free things. I can’t pay anything, so I have to find anything that’s free to listen to. There’s only like one or two free stories, and one is a little kid’s story about a snuggly panda. Something good about this app: You can tell it your mood and write about how you’re felling and why. It’s like a more digital and private version of a diary. Also,  I do like having something to listen to, and Steven Fry’s voice is pretty calming, but that’s all there is to listen to. So, unless you’re willing to pay 60 something bucks a year, or are ok with having a very limited amount of things to listen to, you should think about your decision before you get this app."
399,2019-11-05 11:42:57,3,"I am not sure what happened but this formerly indispensable app has been deleted from my phone. I have been unable to use any of the sleep stories for almost 7 weeks- most do not load and none of the ones I choose to use will play. Instead I get the app’s version of Windows spinning hourglass or a message saying that Calm is unavailable. I have tried at different times of the day and the same thing happens. Very frustrating. Last night after trying for a half hour, I shut the app down. This AM, I was awakened by a random sleep story playing- first time it has worked on over a month. I paid for a year’s subscription so will delete and download/reinstall again later but I have no hope that it will work. Get whatever it is fixed!"
400,2019-10-23 04:48:09,5,"This app is so unbelievably helpful for someone like me who always has something on their mind. It has so many small hidden and wonderful features that help me throughout the day. It’s so crazy to think how 10 minutes of a mediation when I’m laying in bed or how 1 minute of a simple breathing exercise can change my mood or how I feel. When I’m worried, overthinking, nervous, anxious, or whatever bad or negative way I feel or think, opening this app and listening to one of the many sounds, meditations, songs, or stories, just helps me forget, even if it’s just for the moment. I’ve never rated an app before, but I have to say that Calm really deserves its praise."
401,2018-05-04 04:33:59,5,"Due to hormonal issues and medication side effects, I've dealt with anxiety, insomnia and depression for decades. Calm is one of the most practical solutions I've found in that time for these complex issues. 
I find the Meditation guidance incredibly effective for achieving deep relaxation, the personal growth series insightful, the sleep stories a charming surprise and the music and background scenes a convenient way to create my own traveling spa room. 
I like the ease of use. Good number of options, but not too many and monthly check-in emails from my Calm Coach, even though I haven't needed to contact them. 
This is the first app I've paid for and I am so happy with my decision every single day."
402,2019-08-30 11:57:34,3,"I'm going to give this 3 stars for now over limited free content. I downloaded this app in the middle of the night while trying desperately to find something to help me sleep before work this morning. The initial prompt offering the 7 day trial seemed to only give me an option to go forward at all with agreeing to come back to cancel before the astoundingly over priced subscription. 

It now appears that I successfully avoided accepting the subscription, but the odd prompt was deeply confusing for someone so tired that I was searching for help to get some sleep. This is review is equal part time stamp to make sure that I have been clear that I have no intention of subscribing at that rate, should there be any issues with being billed next week."
403,2018-06-13 04:37:37,4,I am new to this app and enjoy it so far. My free trial ends tomorrow and I plan to let the year subscription start. I have tried other apps before but really like this one. I love the calming voices and sounds. One request would be larger font and/or font that stands out more for low vision users. I don’t have trouble with sleep but started listening to the sleep story of the day which I really enjoy. However I fell asleep while listening. The next day I really wanted to know how the story ended and had a hard time figuring out how to find it. Should be an option to find recent activity. Maybe there is but I can’t see it without my readers... lol! Overall really wonderful app and seems like a lot of content!
404,2017-09-03 13:35:49,5,"First of all, the app is designed beautifully. I love all 3 sections (breath, meditation and sleep stories). I use them all. I use Breath occasionally when I need to focus, sometimes to start meditation, to calm down. I use the open ended mediation every morning. It's simply a bell that tolls at intervals so I can keep track of time without having to set a timer in advance. Seems like a small distinction but it's big for a meditation practice. And my boyfriend and I listen to a sleep story at night to help us fall asleep. 

The new release/design has a few issues I hope are addressed. Firstly, for some reason my beloved open-ended meditation isn't making the bell sound so it is silent. 

Please keep making new sleep stories!

Also I love the breathe section and its simplicity but I do believe it would be helpful to include a few more breath exercise options 

I highly recommend trying this app, which for free you can get a good taste of. I sprung for the year membership which in my opinion is expensive so I have high standards for what can be done and its possibilities for the future."
405,2021-01-30 07:21:45,5,"In many ways, Calm has been an incredible source of guidance for me throughout my life. It has introduced me to amazing practices from around the world and helped me to navigate along my journey. Over my time using this program, I’ve been able to develop a mindset that has opened me up to the beauty of wellness and because Calm’s content is always expanding, there’s always something that I can look forward to. It’s brilliantly designed and formatted cohesively with many features that can be tailored to any liking. I can say with sincerity that Calm is one of the best experiences of its kind, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to take the time to practice self care."
406,2020-05-28 07:10:55,5,"Calm is a great app to us for a lot of thing but what I got calm for the most is my sleep I have trouble sleeping at night and when I got calm I was not so sure if I was going to like it but I loved it and it was amazing. I have one thing though if you could have a mute button for the cricket sounds because when I am trying to put my sleep story on I can’t without making a bunch of noise and waking people up in my room I share a room and that wakes her up. I also like calm because of all of the sections like they have like meditation, sleep, and music. The meditation helps when I am doing my work. The music helps when I am lying down. And the sleep helps me with sleep."
407,2020-01-11 09:31:50,5,"I feel like the creators and developers took all the best of the best and combined them here. I like seeing my progress and getting recommendations. The content is top notch. The offline mode is fantastic. The prompts at the end to ask you if you’re calm and if not, they recommend another meditation to try. Their visual breathing exercises is fun and practical. It’s transformed my life and even the kids love it. 

The only very minor hiccup we’ve experienced is with the kid stories. My daughter who uses the app with me is four and we were using the sleep stories - she gets scared by some of the elements like bears. There’s not really a way to filter or preview for little little kids."
408,2020-01-02 02:56:27,5,"The Calm app is so wonderful for someone like me. My mind is so busy and frantic. I have trouble quieting it on my own. To have access to all the different types of guidance Calm offers is a miracle in my life. I used it for free for about a year and was so grateful for the gifts of wellbeing it brought into my life that I actually wanted to support it or finance it. It felt good to actually pay for it! I also feel that it is becoming more expansive and giving as a service. It’s almost as if it is growing in its ability to feel the needs of the people using the app. 
I feel a great sense of commitment to Calm and to myself through growing with it. 
Thank you, Calm"
409,2019-10-20 14:08:31,5,"I use Calm almost everyday. I usually end my workouts sitting in the sauna listening to a meditation series. I listen to it when I go on long stroller walks with my kids. I listen to everything: Breaking Bad Habits, more Success at Work, Being a Better Human... the music, the stories... I love it all. I feel like Calm has helped me tremendously intrinsically. It has helped me rise above, not beat myself up so much and just feel better. 

For suggestions I wouldn’t mind more instructions or even suggestions being that the app is $$ I want to make sure I’m using it to its full potential. Maybe an occasional email you listened to this so you should try this...

Love it!"
410,2018-11-08 20:25:56,5,"I was looking for some type of portable app to keep on my phone for occasional use outside of home. I came across Calm and decided to give it a try. The daily ten minute meditations are perfect! They are quiet, insightful, focus on breathing and ten minutes long. No reading books or guessing how long I have been trying to meditate on my own. The Sleep Stories are awesome!! I’m not a good sleeper - mind wide awake at bedtime. I chose stories in the 30 minute range and have yet to hear the end of one! When I do the meditation in bed just before the story I sleep deeper with less waking during the night. I’ve just begun to explore the additional meditations. It’s a wonderful app - sooo glad I found it."
411,2019-02-02 17:03:22,2,"The Calm app is overall pretty good. I like the idea and the execution is not bad. I think there are still bugs, which is annoying, but manageable. However, when you’re asked to subscribe, there are about 10-12 different options with no details on differentiating factors. There are some that are one month and some that are one year and there are several different price points for each. How confusing! Instead, I decided to cancel after a few days of the free trial. Then, the screen that showed the date that I subscribed and the date that my trial would expire said that the subscription expiration date was “Invalid date”. This whole part of the experience turned me off. If you’re going to make such a great app, make it easy and CLEAR for people who want to subscribe and who want to cancel."
412,2018-10-04 14:47:14,5,"Hi all, I tried the 7day trial and i think this app is amazing! I’ve only been able to explore the surface of what this app can offer and I am impressed. I love the night-stories. The daily grounding meditation and the diverse variety of music to relax. Speaking from someone who battles with anxiety & depression, i just want to say thank you to the developers and their whole team. It truly has helped me and i am sure many others as well. Unfortunately i don’t have the money to pay the yearly subscription at the moment  but when i do i will be subscribing to the 1 year premium. That’s about 4.99 per month and that is a cheap price to help with my anxiety. 

Thank you again! ❤️"
413,2020-07-15 14:43:15,5,"Calm is literally life changing. When I first heard about it (through people and ads and whatnot) I honestly didn’t believe it, it didn’t sound like all that and a bag of chips. 

Then I downloaded it (just for fun) and started using it, started my subscription and free trial and it was incredible. Immediately I noticed that I was sleeping better, I was calmer and more peaceful during the day, the meditations and exercises that I’d been doing through the app was showing immediate benefits (and long term). One of my favorite features is the mood check in, just reflecting on your day... that’s something I didn’t know I needed but love.

All in all, it’s great and defiantly worth it!"
414,2018-06-23 19:17:46,4,"Hi!!  This app looked really helpful on the commercials so I decided to try it out. It’s really great don’t get me wrong, but I didn’t give it five stars like every one else is because it has everything locked. Once you install it it only gives you one session of meditation their are hundreds more but they are all locked. To get them unlocked you have to pay for them... I’m fourteen years old and I have ADHD, and anxiety. I’m just now going into high school, I’m in all Advanced Placement classes, and I’m in softball and band. I don’t have an credit card or any way to buy them! I get that they want to make money on this app but if you really want to help people with their stress and anxiety I think it should ALL be free.  I hope this helped...."
415,2019-02-17 18:06:04,5,"I finally figured out for myself that I prefer one teacher when learning a new thing. At least, initially. I start to get comfortable with the person and I can connect to her vibe and it makes the learning experience more pleasant.  This app is like someone took the time to design a course in meditation for me.  I enjoy having one teacher per course so I definitely like that about this app. With other apps they were too many choices of teachers from all over the world and the selection became overwhelming. It was like trying to order from a Cheesecake Factory menu.  This is just my humble opinion. Good luck with your meditation practice."
416,2018-05-28 17:21:24,5,"Just loving this app. Amazing guidance and training in meditation. I’ve tried other apps and they just are not the same. I haven’t though twice about paying for this app. So many options for meditating to focus on what may be currently bothering you. Amazing for mental health too. Mindfulness and meditation are one of the keys to a good life and this app has showed me how. It’s changed my life. I can’t wait to meditate everyday with Calm. 

Plus you have the bonus sleep sessions! Have trouble sleeping. This app also focuses on that with many different options to choose from suiting every preference. 

Hands down the best mindful meditation and sleep app out there."
417,2018-11-08 00:21:39,4,"This app, especially the sleep stories, has really helped me sleep. And improves my quality of life as a result.  My request would be to add new stories more often because they are so infrequent, it’s easy to just get sick of them and go off to some other method or app.

Here are some thoughts for better functionality for some of us.

Add a button to eliminate sleep stories we don’t want so as not to have to scroll through rows and rows of stories I don’t understand or like.  Often I fall asleep before a story is over and before I can add a heart, forgetting the next day to do it then.

Add a function to allow for continuous play of the masterclass sessions or meditation session.  Also add a shuffle feature for the stories.  It’s a hassle to constantly fumble with the device every few minutes to proceed through sessions.  Personally, I like to use the classes and meditations as sleep stories too.

Similarly, add a function to shuffle through the music.  Again, trying to sleep and constantly waking in the dark to play something else defeats the purpose.

Otherwise, thanks so much, love the app."
418,2018-04-25 06:37:48,5,"I’m a high school student, a little bit depressed and always anxious—around people, at work. I downloaded Calm about a year ago, and it has really helped me compartmentalize my stressful thoughts, and forget about them when I need to. Before bed, or before or during homework is a great time for it.

I don’t really feel safe at school in the sense that there is not a place to hide or be by myself when I am feeling overwhelmed, but the nature audio (which is free) helps me zone out during class, or lunch, or passing period when I’ve got my headphones.

I also have a younger sibling who doesn’t fall asleep when she’s supposed to. Calm has these stories for children (and adults, I believe) and sleep talkdowns also in the app, which I put on for her. It always works.

I introduced the app to my friends and my mom and so far everyone has had a use for it. A lot of my apps I lose a purpose for and end up deleting them for space—Calm is not one of those. It’s got a wide variety of uses, great technical support who listen to feedback, and best of all it’s given me peace of mind."
419,2020-12-24 04:24:00,5,"This app has completely turned me around when it came to my sleeping patterns. I’ve been able to create a regular sleeping pattern that works for me and I’ve never slept better and woken up so refreshed. I also have very bad anxiety, anger, and depression and every time I feel the need to step back and take a break I open calm and listen to one of their meditations or practice breathing. Although this may not be the same for everyone, I find using this app has helped me more than my medication and therapy does (although if you truly do feel the need to get help please do contact a professional). This app has been a life saver and is life changing."
420,2020-10-24 12:53:28,5,"I’ve always been someone that has to have the room dark and absolutely no sounds whatsoever when I sleep. Now that my husband and I are getting older and especially these crazy stressful times with covid we decided to try Calm because we have so many friends using it and swearing by it. We have to use it every night and it’s is the most calming, soothing and relaxing experience I’ve had and it puts us to sleep. Never did I think this would work in a million years but we have never heard the end to one story! I love all the other features/stories it has for anytime of the day. Best thing we have purchased in a long time."
421,2020-01-03 09:45:07,5,"I really like this app and use it as a white noise every night! I am hoping to get some more money so i can get premium at some point because it is really a good app that has many features that I would like to try out when i get the chance! There are a lot of free features to but some what limited compared to the premium features.. The features I use are the breathing exercises, the background scenes white noise, and the music. As a highschooler, I am always overwhelmed with homework, school, family, sports life and this app has really helped me over the months. overall is a very good app and highly recommend it! It definitely helps me destress!🤍"
422,2020-04-13 10:30:06,1,"I have used Calm App for YEARS, even in my classroom with my students, and have really enjoyed the content. I am however, rather disappointed as year after year things that used to be free are now locked and there is no access unless you pay the subscription. As of today I now only have one free sleep sound left out of all of my “hearted favorites”. The FREE portion of this app has come to be almost nonexistent. You might as well now advertise as an app to purchase (instead of an app “offering In-App Purchases”) since there is little to no FREE content with most content now being locked. (The subscriptions are overpriced —That money greed.) All good things come to an end. It was great while it lasted.
As I’ve read, there are a lot of reviews like mine sprinkled in between all of those 5 Star reviews. They will only increase. Calm should listen to and consider those “awake stories”!"
423,2019-01-03 21:28:06,5,"For somebody diagnosed with adult ADHD I have been constantly searching for something that could help my brain combat the constant energy zapping thoughts and distractions I had become so accustomed to living with every day. This app works better than any drug I’ve been prescribed. After completing a session my brain feels refreshed and ready to go - filled with endorphins and more balanced - as if weights have been lifted off of and replaced by a certain ‘afterglow.’ ;) Although it takes a bit of time to train your brain to relax, the excellent guidance will ensure you can practically use your techniques throughout the coming days/months. Very highly recommended!"
424,2019-10-18 05:22:00,1,"I've had this app for a good 4 years or so. Daily calm used to be free, and they locked it after an update quite a while ago. I was disappointed but whatever, never got to try it and mostly just use the app for the nature sounds. open it today after not using for a few months and now some of my favorite go-to nature sounds are locked? after being free for years? I’m a broke college student and can’t afford a subscription. I have to say I’m more satisfied with insight timer than calm at this point. used to be one of my favorite apps but... they really want to push this subscription thing. insight timer doesn’t do that. you can pay money if you want, but there’s plenty of free stuff. not to mention, the user interface keeps getting more and more confusing with every change. goodbye calm. I suppose nothing lasts forever."
425,2019-06-07 12:40:11,4,"I definitely get a lot from this app. All the different types of meditations, specified topics, and even just ambient noise and music helps me to focus my thoughts and calm my mind. I am strongly against paying, however, to access the majority of the content. It’s not that it’s expensive, and I get that they can’t offer it all for free. I think that because I work with folks who can really benefit from this content, but can’t afford to pay, I see people feel further discouraged from an app that’s meant to be helpful. So in a way I refuse to pay to show myself that it helps even with limited access, so I am congruent with any recommendations of this app I give to folks regardless of their ability to pay."
426,2018-11-12 01:52:44,5,"A friend recommended the app and I absolutely love everything about it. It’s more than just meditation.  I have been using this app for 8 months and it has been life changing.  I usually don’t pay for subscriptions however this app is so worth every penny and I will continue to subscribe!  It has brought so much peace, patience and yes calmness to my life.  I do the daily calm every day and absolutely love that Tamara teaches us something new in every meditation.  The sleep stories and master classes are amazing as well! The Facebook community is truly one of the kindest groups I’ve ever been a part of. So encouraging and non-judgemental.  Everyone at Calm is amazing!!!"
427,2020-08-11 12:47:20,3,"I saw advertisements with very satisfying videos.  One was a long cube being cut into nine thinner blocks.  The other was kind of like traveling through space in a glowing worm hole.  I am in the seven day free trial of the premium and can’t find those.  They were so satisfying to watch.  I want to watch them over and over.  I listened to a sleep story last night, it relaxed me but did not put me to sleep.  The guided meditations are nice.  The only way I will possibly pay for this is if you show me what I came for.  Also, hot tip... if you want to pay for a year, cancel the app and you get  a thirty percent off offer immediately. If you go into your iTunes subscriptions, there are several different prices for a one year subscription to premium.  Discount baby!"
428,2019-03-25 05:16:59,1,This app is such a scam! It says it’s “free” but only having it on your phone is free you can’t do anything on this app without buying premium. I mean you can’t even do a full week of something only the first day that is so stupid like at least give us a couple ones with full week use but no. Don’t download this app they only want your money and they don’t want to help you and it is so ridiculous. I know there is the whole free 7 day trial but who wants to do that you should have free stuff on the app I’m not saying everything has to be free just have some where you can do the whole week for example the one titled happiness you can listen to the first chapter but after that you have to pay! I hate apps like these and I hope the people who made this don’t make much money because your just a cheap skate and I won’t have that.
429,2018-11-29 09:20:28,2,"I used to love this app, I would come to it here and there when I really needed meditation. Even just doing the 7 days of calm every now and then was great help. However, since the app updated, it is extremely limited. You can do a single session and the rest you must pay YEARLY for. $60! Honestly, the biggest stressor in my life is money and it is seriously terrible to see an app that is meant to help with stress, sleep, etc., make a leap like this. Is your goal to help people, or make more money? Really curious what happened for this change to be made to this app. Making a profit out of it just seems incredibly ironic if that’s what’s happening here. 

Overall, don’t waste your time downloading this app. You’re going to be more stressed out than when you decided to download it in the first place."
430,2017-11-21 11:54:45,5,"I’ve found this app to be a real asset in my life. My FD/EMS community has been working on trying to assess some of the more current research regarding stress injury/PTSD that effects our community. As an instructor and Lieutenant, it made focus more on actionable steps we could take and that my crew could take. Most of us are often operating in a zone of heightened stress...and that’s without the challenges of our personals lives. This past year has really pushed me to take action, to try and balance my stress response, and this app has been very helpful in my pursuit to include mindfulness meditation into my daily routine. I would say that I’m better for it and definitely recommend it."
431,2018-05-01 07:31:38,4,"I thoroughly enjoy this program.   I am just starting to utilize it, but I appreciate the variety and volume of meditative options. I am working on the discipline of carving out time for the truly important things like health, prayer and reflection.  I like most people today struggle with busyness. Let’s face it we’re all busy whether your a stay-at-home person or Fortune 500 executive. There’s always something that needs to be done.  Calm is a tool that reminds you and helps you prioritize talking time for you, your mental health, your spiritual(not necessarily religious) health & and your physical health. To wok at one’s optimal levels you need balance and anchors that Keep you firing on all cylinders. Calm is one of those anchors."
432,2020-08-03 17:51:01,5,Hello my name is Anthony and I am 14 yers old and I have been during the calm app for about a month now and it is so helpful. I have extreme depression to where I had to go to a mental hospital because I slit my wrist and had to get 6 stitches and when I was there I learned about this app called the calm app and as soon as I got out it changed my life I see the world in a whole new direction yes it is a lot of money but you only have to pay one time and let me tell you it is worth it this app is so good and it was worth every Penney and yes obviously my depression has not gone away but do you know what has my self harming urges and thoughts thanks calm for saving my life.🙂
433,2020-01-03 03:51:32,5,"For anyone looking to de-stress and improve their relationship with themselves, you should definitely try this amazing app. I downloaded it this past October and it has changed my life. 

I used to meditate a lot in college, but after I graduated and got a job I fell behind in my practice. But after dealing with anxiety and depression, I decided it was time to bring meditation back into my life. 

Not only does it help me de-stress and focus, it also helps my stomach problems, my chronic pain, and pushes me to bring mindfulness into every aspect of my life. For anyone wishing to make a change in themselves for the better, I HIGHLY recommend Calm!"
434,2020-07-20 13:45:28,3,"I am feel torn about Calm.  What I’m about to say seems counterintuitive to the entire purpose of this app but here it goes anyway.   I have an incredibly hard time listening to any meditations narrated by Tamara Levitt.  And unfortunately, she is the predominant narrator on the app!   I actively seek out meditations where there is a choice of narrators because her voice does anything but calm me. A quick internet search on this topic yielded proof that I was not alone in my thoughts.  That being said, if she’s not narrating, I have listened to many master classes and the app has definitely helped my meditation and mindfulness practice.  Please consider offering a choice of narrators as I feel like I’m missing out on much the app has to offer and question whether there’s a point to renew my subscription."
435,2020-02-15 14:58:05,4,"This app is amazing. This is my first night of sleeping using this app and it worked! Every night when I sleep, I just feel like I can’t fall asleep. But this one made me fell asleep in a crack! I wasn’t even that sleepy. 
The thing is, I don’t wanna spend money to buy premium. And if I don’t, there are barely any stories that are not premium. I think because there are barely any stories, you should HAVE to buy premium and that’s just wasting money and giving the money to this.
Because of this, I only rate 4 stars. It’s like I have to listen to the same stories over and over again. There is probably only 1 story in each category. Please fix this and add more non-premium ideas."
436,2019-10-31 13:54:16,5,"Finding this app has been the best thing. Being an overly anxious person I needed to find something that could help me release any anxiety or stress instantly and this app does just that. I love Tamara, her voice is so calming and soothing. The daily calm touches on such strong and useful tools to help me get through my day. I've learned that anxiety is so powerful but I'm even more powerful. More powerful to change my thoughts and recognize when my feelings are genuine or all just made up in my mind. I just love this app and all that is has done for me. It's a slow process to change but Tamara makes it's a lot easier."
437,2019-08-10 14:52:58,5,"The most beneficial investment I’ve ever done! It was a bit hard to start with especially that I have severe ADD and my mind is always restless, gets bored easily, and can’t be organize. However with “Staying on track” set of meditation it tackles all of these issues. It made it a bit easier. After that I started the 7 days of calm that was a bit challenging but I used to praised myself even if I was able to calm my brain for split of a secound. The break through happened in the set “21 days of calm” on day 10 this meditation is called “grasping and aversion” it was a completely new technique that worked the best for my ADD brain. Highly recommended app."
438,2019-07-17 05:55:05,5,I love this Calm app each night. It has helped me sleep better and I rarely hear the end of any sleep story. The one thing that I don’t like is that it takes many tries to get the app to work. I touch it and it says ”take a deep breath”. Then it disappears and goes back to my home screen. Very annoying. I counted 12 times that it did this before I could choose a sleep story. What is wrong? Why does it take so many tries to get it to work. I’ve rebooted and turned it off then on. Still does it. Please let me know what to do. I paid $70 for it. I need it each night!
439,2019-06-05 18:50:51,5,"I wish there were a couple more unlocked sleep stories. At the least, the kids may beg for the full app sub. Even so, we had so many options with kindle and audible + that we can play for twenty minutes. More free choices would at least give the calm app exposure. The 5 stars are for potential. I’ll check by ever now and again. Ten grandkids that I influence myself, imagine if I told all my friends with at least ten grands about calm, if they had better than a 7 day intro, a by the book purchase plan, or other ideas that separated you from all the others. Calm is a good idea and potentially a great app in future."
440,2019-03-23 10:58:56,5,"I would love to give this app five stars. However I am fifteen and can’t afford to pay $70 annually so I got the free version. While I am sure it is a wonderful app if you can pay, there are very few options for free. For those of you who want to get the free version and avoid getting tricked into a subscription, simply press the x in the top left corner. I recommend the breathing exercises! Please Calm, make this more open to people without tons of money! Mindfulness should be free!
Furthermore there is a new update which I have tried downloading MANY TIMES but it doesn’t work. It will work for one day and then the next day it tells me I never updated it. Please fix!"
441,2019-05-02 02:05:37,4,"I’m only on day 2 of my 7 day trial but I really love everything about this app. I used simple habits for over a year but I might have to cancel my subscription after using this app. The main things I love about this app are the scenic backgrounds that I just discovered you can change, the general aesthetic look of it all is really nice, and the quotes at the end of a session! I gave it 4 stars (and it would really be 4.5 if that were possible) because I wish they had more videos w/softer voice overs. I find some of the louder toned voices can be distracting to me & even when I really like the topic of that session I have to move out of it. I also wish the ASMR section had a lot more in it. Nonetheless, it’s a great app."
442,2018-11-09 23:40:08,5,"I don’t usually write reviews, however, I feel I must share! I only have my cellphone to communicate, so I was gifted with THE Best Anxiety reduction tool for our current political discussions & I thought writing “ need to impeach” cards to citizen voters 
 of this Already Great Country, was reducing my current Stress level! CALM app 
Is redirecting those invasive mental aggravations, that keep my cortisol levels from taking a nosedive & yelling at The Donald, or any other White Supremacist, who won’t stop lying. Resisting his rhetoric & taking care of yourself is really important, so We can Fight Back with words & actions when necessary. 
I’m not new to meditation, but this app reminds political wonks to Take a 15 minute break & breathe!"
443,2020-06-09 06:07:40,5,"So I originally bought this app because with 3 small children during covid the only way I can get things done around the house is when they are all sleeping. I started going to bed around midnight on a regular basis, but trying to fall asleep was really hard. Your sleep stories got me to sleep within minutes and I have yet to finish one even if I’ve listened to it multiple times. When my kids, ages 2-10, are a little wound up I put on your kids sleep stories and they sleep soundly through the night. We love it! But I will say I would like more adult one with Matthew McConahay cuz his voice is just dreamy."
444,2020-10-02 07:49:35,1,"Pretty much everything on the app you need to pay for. I started using calm forever ago but very quickly ran through their EXTREMELY limited sleep story section.  They’ll add a story for about a week and then lock it so only premium users can listen which is totally unfair. After listening to the same stories over and over again I was pretty much only using it for the soundscapes. Then I found an amazing app called Rain Rain which has more soundscapes and even lets you mix and match sounds. Calm is no longer downloaded on my phone and in my mind is basically just a waste of time unless you feel like spending whatever extreme price they’re charging. (Also if you are thinking of getting their premium membership beware, I’ve read some horror stories about how they won’t let you cancel you membership or overcharge people’s cards)"
445,2020-02-13 17:41:12,5,"This app is incredible. Over the past year and a half, this app has helped me cultivate a mindfulness practice and has taught me many strategies for managing stress and anxiety. I love the meditations and the sleep stories. I use it daily!

One suggestion would be to add settings for Sleep Stories and Music (separately) to either ""play one"" or ""continue to next."" I prefer to play one sleep story at a time (currently the default), but I have been deterred from playing music to fall asleep because it automatically continues to the next track. That said, others might want one sleep story to roll into the next. I'd love to be able to choose!"
446,2019-08-28 14:54:32,5,"The calm app is amazing. I do their ten minute daily calm and it’s a new subject every day. The techniques they teach you in the daily calm also build off of each other. I’ve never had a consistent mediation practice but calm makes it easy and I look forward to it every day. I can 100% see a difference in my mental health and emotions day to day. On top of that, their sleep stories and music have also been really helpful. I’m surprised at how much some of the stories help me fall back asleep. I’m really grateful for this app, it’s also beautifully designed and easy to use. Worth the yearly subscription for sure, you deserve it!"
447,2020-01-04 09:46:32,3,"So look I’m 15 and as many of you should get an idea I don’t have a debit card and I really like the idea of this app and it does help BUT I hate that their is only one option when I need actually a little bit more I get it the creators need money but their is a better way, first is if you open up a bit more people will actually use it and keep it because when I first got it I looked and saw only one story was open which I was just gonna delete the app but I gave it a try and I loved it but many will not give it that one try. Another way is if you put ads so people can watch for in app credit so over time they can accumulate enough to buy one story section, which from the adds the creators will get more money."
448,2017-09-17 15:52:26,5,"I'm new to mindfulness and meditation activities. I have a lot of stress which turns in to physical symptoms (migraines, stomach issues, etc), irritability and insomnia. It actually takes effort for me to stop the world for 10 minutes so that I can listen to the daily calm. But it's so worth it. I truly notice a difference in how I feel and react to others. Sometimes, the daily message is so relevant that it brings me to tears. My personal goal is to use this app every single day. The other half of that goal is no judgement when I don't.  Highly recommend and in fact I have and do recommend to everyone. It's a mini therapy visit...who couldn't use that everyday?"
449,2018-06-16 12:44:53,4,"I use this app every night, as I enjoy all of the bed time stories, however I do not understand why the bedtime stories are repeated within a few weeks.  I will go to the library of stories to pick another, sometimes I just listen to the chosen one, because I honestly fall asleep long before they are over, which is why I so love this app. I also love the meditations. I use this everyday, without fail. It is worth the money in my opinion!     Just over 16 cents a day, for a good nights rest and meditation to keep my stress down and centered, a bargain!

Update, I continue to absolutely love this app, use it every day, it has noticeably ""calmed"" me. I have discovered many other features. So. Worth . it."
450,2020-11-08 23:57:04,5,"UPDATE:  I had to cut back on the app subscription.  I’m very disappointed by both the increase in the paywall & the dearth of ‘non-premium” content.  Priced out & no content.  😭😢

I honestly don't remember what brought Calm to my attention, but I downloaded and within a couple of weeks I not only upgraded to the annual subscription (something I NEVER do as I'm usually ok with freemium) but never once regretted it.  Not only have I found the meditations outstanding, I am totally addicted to the Sleep Stories - which is weird because I've yet to hear the end of a single one (which I think is part of the goal).  😴😴😴"
451,2020-04-26 04:14:26,5,"I’ve tried many meditation apps, and I am not one to purchase anything, but Calm is by far the best app! I love that I can set it with or without background music, and the selection is amazing. I was suffering from panic attacks for the first time in my life, and the Calm app has helped me overcome panic and anxiety. There are meditations like emergency calm and anxiety release which help you calm down immediately, as soon as I feel anxious I do one of these or the daily calm and I have immediate relief. Sometimes I just play the music in the background during yoga or reading, and my kids love the stories and fall asleep to them every night. Worth every penny!"
452,2020-04-18 04:50:02,5,When i saw the ad for this I thought about getting the app but I didn’t but I started getting problems with talking and stress. When i get stressed out I pick at my eyebrows I don’t know why it’s just something I do. My mom wanted me to stop picking at them. She noticed that I had a bit of a hard time with stress and anxiety. Then she told me that I was not talking about any of it and said all I didn’t was say  I don’t know all the time. I didn’t want her to bering me to the doctors. I saw this app I thought I would try it to see how well it worked. This app has helped me so much thank you guys for making this app happen!❤️
453,2020-03-15 12:35:36,5,"Dear People Who are interested,
This app is crazy awesome! It's so calming. I listen to books, and listen to sessions (some are free), and my favorite mood journal! It's beautiful books like 'Floating With The Florida Manatees' and 'Luna's Lullaby' and much more. I love doing daily sessions and being able to show my friends how much it does. It changes my heart and makes me feel confident. When I feel weak and scared I just go on calm and start some sessions and listen to some nice books. I gaze over at the wall and I finally want to move out of my house! I just want to give a big thanks to the maker of calm, Christi! Thanks Christi for making my life a tad bit better!
Sincerely,
SmartReviews"
454,2019-02-19 09:29:41,5,"Calm is an excellent modern way to easy guided meditation.  I love the ability to choose different narrators voices.  I also like the different downloadable backgrounds and sounds that accompany them. It’s also great how there is a new daily meditation, it’s a nice touch! 

One request would be if Calm could start to include pain management meditations.  Meditations to help with things like Chronic Migraines, Cancer diagnoses, Crohns, Parkinson's, or even meditations focused around dealing with grief.   

I decided to go for the subscription because I got a deal from WhatReallyHappened. It was a good call, and I’m glad the discount helped me decide to get it.  It’s a great APP guys, you should feel really proud!"
455,2019-06-16 15:20:12,3,"This is a great app with lots of options! One thing it’s missing (which I’ve found to be VERY helpful on another similar app called Breethe), is the ability to have music or stories be shuffled or auto-repeated (either once, or until you choose to stop it). I have a tough time sleeping, but do better when I can hear a soft voice talking (or other soothing sounds) throughout the night. I most often fall asleep during a story (yay!), but as soon as the story or music ends on this app..I wake back up. So I started using the Breethe app for sleep because I can choose to have either stories or music be repeated over and over..and thus, I sleep longer! I’d most likely use the Calm app more often if it included this option."
456,2018-12-11 12:32:14,5,"I never thought I could relax enough to mediate, but she made it very easy as she walks you through each session.  I also got frustrated in the beginning and thought I wasn’t doing things correctly and she explains that EVERYONE looses focus and everyone’s mind wanders and it’s ok, just go back to the breath.  Now I am on a 103 day streak and look forward to my mediation every morning before I get out of bed and if I feel anxious during the day I stop and do another and it helps me to relax and focus on now.  I also have learned to just take a few breaths and let go and that can help me stop the cycle of anxiety before it gets out of control"
457,2020-08-29 22:12:58,5,"I’ve had Calm for about 3 years now, and I can easily say it’s the best app on my phone. I use it every day, if not in the morning, I listen to one of the bedtime stories or night meditations to calm my mind down. (Stephen Fry ‘Lavender Valley’ is a favorite, and even though I’ve listened to it over 20x, it still knocks me out).  Because of the variety of 7 day series, I feel like I’m learning and growing through my practice. It’s been 3 years and I haven’t listened to everything Calm has to offer. 
I boast to my friends about this app, and as a personal trainer, I recommend it to all of my clients. Love, love, love Tamara and the Calm team 🙌🏽 thank you guys!"
458,2020-08-18 12:49:56,4,"When I first got Calm about a year ago, I was really stressed out and couldn’t get to sleep. I was taking 6-10 mg of melatonin a night which was really unhealthy for my body (I am 13). Calm was truly a life changer because it taught me to meditate and had amazing sleep stories and a good amount of them were free. Then calm switched mostly all of their stuff to premium so I stopped using the app. After a visit to the doctor I was told to try meditation again and I immediately thought of calm. My parents capped the limit at $30 a year and they thought $60 was outrageous. I really think that calm is amazing and of you can pay for premium I definitely think it would be worth it."
459,2020-06-11 17:43:04,4,"I think the app is great, but I don’t want to spend $70 a year just so I can sleep better! Can’t you add more things that are free and don’t involve money or free trials or whatever? From what I’ve seen, I can only find 4 stories that will help me sleep that are free! This is very infuriating so I hope you change this.
I know you need money, but there are lots of stories I want to listen to and the only way is a free trial or paying $70!! If you need the money, you could’ve just made almost everything free and then have people pay when they want the app! It’s very simple. I hope you change this fact, and if you do, then I will give you 5 stars and no complaints or question."
460,2020-04-28 14:58:26,5,"With all this time that we have to ourselves in quarantine, if you have any to yourself, one might find that they are running out of things to do. Investing in yourself is always important and if you have time to yourself, this app is amazing for those who want to empower themselves and find a way to be more productive, or more level-headed or just more, calm. There’s a lot of other things that I can say about this app because it has such a WIDE RANGE of uses but I won’t because I personally haven’t gotten to them yet to speak about it. So far, it’s worth every penny because it’s already making me into a better “me”."
461,2019-05-06 22:23:47,5,"Calm has been a great blessing for me. I’ve tried multiple of the meditation apps, and to me, Calm is the gold standard. The guidance is thoughtful and ministerial. The design is simple, clean, well-executed, and consonant with a deep, peaceful, renewing experience. The content is well organized, and thoughtfully produced. The gamification elements are minimalist and tasteful (which is an accomplishment in and of itself). I’m a paid annual subscriber, and I consider it some of the best money I spend.  I’ve also shared the app with others and have enjoyed watching them experience the benefits of Calm. If you’re looking for great meditation and mindfulness, this is the place. Nothing better on the App Store!"
462,2018-11-07 00:13:21,5,"I’ve literally never written a review for an app, but I’m so passionate about this one, I’ve decided to to! I’ve been using calm for nearly a year-started with just the sleep stories-which are second to none. I feel like I am transported to another world with these informative tales, and the narrators voices are so soothing. I’ve yet to stay awake through one yet! The graphics and images are gorgeous, and I’ve recently gotten more into the meditations-there are so many for varying emotions-as well as the daily calm. I can’t say enough about this app, and it is worth the hefty price tag to subscribe for a year-do yourself a favor and download now!"
463,2017-09-15 22:31:52,5,"I recently started meditating after coming home from a rough day at work which capped off a rough week at work. I was so stressed that I had noticed it earlier in the week, it was like a knot in the back of my neck, and it hurt! I tried one session and I felt so much calmer, less worried about the problems that had been troubling me all week. I faithfully kept it going until I completed the 7 days of calm and it helped tremendously. My wife had walked in on a couple of sessions and joined me, she now asks if we are going to meditate each night. I plan to join the paid subscription soon so that I can continue with more focused sessions."
464,2017-09-09 12:16:08,5,"I never write reviews, but this app has changed my life. From the first day I used it, I felt the depression, rage, and frustration I was feeling melt away. Things don't always go as planned with friends, family, the world, and in life, but this app has helped me navigate frustrations and really live in the moment ... Appreciating every day and what it has to offer. I cannot recommend it enough! 
I went through the 21 day trial and then tried another meditation app to compare before committing to this one for a year's subscription, but it didn't have the same effect. This has been my first experience with meditation and it's amazing!"
465,2017-09-09 04:27:55,5,I've been using this app with another to get my daily meditation time in for just short of one year. I can't say enough about how much I appreciate the Daily Calm feature. It focuses on a daily topic after leading the listener through a meditation exercise. The topics are varied so you don't feel as though you are rehashing something you just listened to recently and they are broad enough to touch on many thoughts to help expand your view of the world. I listen at the end of my day and look forward to it every evening as a way to cleanse and broaden my mind in one sitting. Thank you for offering such a wonderful feature
466,2021-01-21 01:22:45,5,I’ve been using this app for over two years and absolutely love it..use it to put my grandson down for a nap too.. he loves the Velveteen Rabbit.  My favs are Jerome Flynn and Stephen Frye and just to many to list them all.  Even got my three aunts hooked...the giggles that came from them as soon as Matthew McConaughey says “hello there” was hilarious..they are all between the ages of 65-70.. my husband and I use it almost every night and I really don’t think we’ve ever made it though one to the end.  The music is also very relaxing and my dogs (two English bulldogs) also love relaxing to the stories and music..definitely worth the money I paid for the app
467,2021-01-04 12:44:25,5,"This app has provided a pleasant and meaningful experience for me over the past 3 years. It has provided coaching and guided insight as I have strengthened my daily meditations and have sought to bring meaningful mindfulness into my life. I have found “what works for me” out of the large variety of content, customizable background sounds/music/volume and coaches. The cost has risen to support the expansion of new content, most of which I have not found appealing, but it’s there for those who do. I would like to hear an expanded selection of looped sound tracks for deep meditation, such as singing bowls.  Thank you for a wonderful, meaningful offering."
468,2019-02-25 04:27:07,5,"I never in my wildest dreams imagined myself using an App such as this! I’m a high strung, energetic individual. It takes a lot to slow me down. I must say, I achieved complete relaxation through this amazing App:) I’m still in my “Trial” and have every intention on purchasing the whole year! I especially love the detailed stories. I feel as if I’m really there, inside the story. I love the narrators accents, all of them:) I thought the price was a little steep until I examined all of the wonderful categories. There is definitely something for everyone, and it may surprise you to find interests in areas you never thought possible:)) Thank you developers!"
469,2019-06-25 06:49:22,3,"I subscribed the this yearly. At the time I could play the soundscapes in the background while doing other things like reading, then it began crashing. I began timing it after I started the music. Almost every time it would restart the application after one minute (+-20 seconds). I have removed and reinstalled the application 4 times.
	Everytime I use the apple watch v4 Calm app I have to manually record the session on the iphone. I have removed and reinstalled the application/complication at least once.

Why isn’t the apple watch app recording my calendar streaks?
Why isn’t the meditation soundscapes/music working in background? I pay for a year and will happily pay for lifetime if these are fixed."
470,2018-12-03 06:18:26,5,"I’m coming up on my one year anniversary of using calm and I had been asking myself if the app was worth to pay for another year. 

I don’t have the money to put $60/year on any app, but when I saw what Calm added to their collection, I knew it would be more than worth it again. 

I have spend 82 hours on Calm since downloading almost a year ago. You can check on my math but that comes out about to paying a penny for every minute I meditate. Like a pay phone! 

I digress. The change I have seen in my life is worth every cent. I struggle with ADHD, anxiety, depression, & PTSD, this app continually provides me with the tools to manage my symptoms. 

I’m not kidding when I say I have more energy (since I’m not expending so much mental energy on negative thoughts and worries), I call fall asleep easier, I quit smoking, I was able to be more productive at work, less burn out, less stress, etc. 

I have been working with a therapist as well but this has been a huge tool in my recovery and for that I’m very thankful."
471,2018-11-10 08:39:07,5,"When 2018 began, I had few resolutions like everybody, meditation was one off them and I tried many apps and used 3 meditations apps daily one in morning, one afternoon & last one at evening. After a month's trial,I got rid of other and sticked to Calm. Not because others were bad but Calm's presentation was more alluring. It's style is more sophisticated than others. Music, stories, UI, everything is well made.

I have currently 300+ continuous streak. This app has winded down my days 'Calmly'. This app is must have for all & best example for how softwares can improve life. And thank you developers for such a masterpiece & I love Tamara Levitt's narration."
472,2018-07-05 14:44:08,5,"This meditation app has been amazing. Full disclosure, I practice vipassana and have been meditating for years. Recently I found this app during a particularly hard family circumstances and my anxiety was at an all time high. This app, combined with therapy, exercise, sleep, mindful eating, and my spiritual practice, has been life altering. I am so thankful for how clear and soothing Tamara’s voice is. And the meditations are an excellent way to bridge the gap between therapy work and spiritual practice. Tho, the meditations are not associated with any religions or particular spiritual practices. Highly recommend this for those struggling with anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, or just want to work on self care."
473,2018-01-27 17:56:07,5,"I’ve been using this app for quite some time now. I love the Daily Calm meditations, particularly the imaged quotes at the end. Often times they are so lovely that I save images and share them. I rarely write reviews, but the one Friendly Global suggestion I have, as a woman of color, is to add more diversity of individuals to the images. As I actually have invested in the paid version, I think this is a reasonable request and one that many users, current, new, and those you hope to attract, would appreciate. Know that this suggestion is coming from a place of positive intention and I hope that it is taken as such. #Calm"
474,2018-04-19 21:10:04,1,"I canceled the day before my subscription was supposed to charge me, conveniently it didn’t take my cancellation and now I have a year of some meditation app that I don’t want.

Why charge people for a year reoccurring charge when it’s much easier to accidentally forgive a charge for a month. Example I wouldn’t be so mad if your company screwed me out of nine dollars, but you screwed me out of Close to $60! Maybe for Rich app designers that’s exactly what you do screw middle America out of their money that they work very hard for! 
I deleted your app because while I might have to pay for it, I would rather choke and die before I use it! You stole money from me is the way I see it, and Apple, and iTunes was your frontier your wild wild west, good for you... now excuse me while I have to go work another four hours to make up the money you took from me! dirt bag"
475,2018-02-23 05:22:19,4,"My favorite part of this app is the myriad of nature sounds and scenes; I would way rather go to sleep to a crackling fire or a thunderstorm, rather than the more synthetic “musical selections in the sleep category, but there is no way to set a sleep timer on those :( and I don’t want my phone running all night. I’m not a big fan of the synthetic “musical” sleep options that run for over an hour, but even if I were I would want to set my own timer (I’m usually asleep in less than a half hour of laying down). Something like what pandora offers would be great - then I could pick my favorite nature sound and set it to shut off in 15 or 20 or 30 min depending on what I need."
476,2017-11-19 01:26:12,5,"This app is so helpful. Really am glad to have found it!
I am only on day 4 of this, but greatly appreciate the effect this is having on my inner-self. There's been just so much noise, incessant inputs from our noisy and screen-driven culture. Taking time to find, and cultivate a quiet serene inner space is priceless.
4 months later-I am still enjoying this wonderful collection of meditations, and practitioners. I would more than recommend this app, I would say it is essential equipment for life.
6 months later. Do yourself a favor and get this wonderful app, invest some time into the miracle that your life really is. Connect with the source of your power and be refreshed. Namaste. 🙏"
477,2017-09-14 11:19:56,5,"Review Update Sept 14: It keeps getting better and better.  The new updates and music are spot on.  You will love it if you try it.

The free service gives a new person to meditation everything that they need to comfortable begin practicing mindfulness.  The ability to choose your own timed mediation for when you just really need that 5 min ""Serenity Now"" moment is perfection.  I purchased a the monthly membership and doing through some of the targeted meditations and everything is impressive so far.  Only a 1/4 through the paid content but happy with my purchase so far.  Keep up the great work."
478,2021-01-13 19:24:08,5,"I was rewarded this app because I’m a k4 teacher and I like to incorporate mindfulness and meditation into out daily schedule. Initially it was a bit pricey so, I kept waiting and eventually they began their school program, which waived the membership fee for teachers!  This has been an amazing addition to our room. The meditations, soundscapes, and sleep stories are some of my students favorite part of the day. It definitely sets the tone and helps aid an open and inviting atmosphere. It’s an extra treat that after a long days work with 4 and 5 yr olds, I can use the same app to calm down and energy me time at home!"
479,2021-02-15 15:04:20,4,There needs to be a LIVE customer support system.... I know Tamara is busy rolling in the dough but she needs to offer an actual support system when the app has issues. The automated system is useless. The app Is pretty freakin awesome.... just been having issues with scene volume which is one of the best features that sets this app apart from other guided meditation apps. When I contact “customer support” it’s an endless loop of pre written “generic” answers to an otherwise very specific problem. Sometimes these answers seem to cater to older people that may not be familiar with the basic operations of a smart phone. A little pandering. Other than that it is a superb app.
480,2020-01-13 23:42:38,5,I am grateful to have this app. This app was recommended to me by my counselor to help me control my emotions and stress. I’ve been using it for 3 months now and people around me are noticing positive changes in my attitude and behavior. I feel like a new person compared to who I was before I had this app. It has taught me so many things to make me a better person and the world around me is so much easier to exist in. I will always keep this app. It’s the most important thing that I do each day. It has modules on just about every situation that I might need help with. I recommend it to anyone because there is something in it for everyone!!
481,2020-10-16 17:47:41,3,"I’m sure it’s helpful to other people, but based solely as a meditation app this is the most cumbersome app I’ve ever used. As a meditation app, what I most need is a quick way to find a session with ideal time, music, along with the amount of guidance. Calm makes browsing for this a complete nuisance.

First, there’s absolutely no way to browse or search based on time. Their Daily Calm sessions are around 10-15 minutes, but they vary by day? But if my range is around 20-30 minutes then I absolutely have to dig around different topics and collections just to see how long they are. I would have to do this every single time, which is an aggravating experience and ruins my attempt at building a daily meditation habit!

They do have a timed meditation section (sorted by time), but it’s silent with or without guidance. I just want time, music, guidance, and go.

After trying it for 3 days, I resorted to going back to a completely free app called Oak. As a sleep or music app, maybe that helps others, but the meandering stories tend to keep me awake more often than just putting on a free podcast. Hope this review is helpful to you!"
482,2019-10-03 02:32:18,5,"I took a chance on Calm’s premium subscription first with a trial then paid for a year and I will never cancel it unless they totally break it. I will go without groceries before I cancel my subscription because I sleep so well after listening to the sleep stories. It’s a rare night that I make it more than 5 minutes into one before passing out and there are so many to choose from! The addition of so many guided meditations is great too, but for me the value is in the sleep stories. The interface is very easy to use and new content is constantly being added."
483,2019-06-17 15:15:20,5,Love the app and used to tell all my friends to try the free “7 days of Calm” even a couple times before they make a decision. Once they did that they were hooked and usually joined — as the mindfulness part after a couple days is what really grabs you and sets this app apart.   Unfortunately someone has now made the decision to force you to put up funds and “try it for free for 7 days” after the first meditation — people new to meditation aren’t sold after that first session. Please bring back the 7 days before the sales pitch! Those 7 days — even if someone repeats them — were the secret to your success.
484,2018-07-30 11:02:45,5,"I work in a profession full of deadlines and have also some significant issues in my life that cause me pain. It’s very, very hard to clear my mind. I appreciate these lessons and am trying hard to put them into practice— and see that my impatience about achieving this is part of what I have to learn. The small discipline of doing my lesson first thing in the morning, before I get up, before I turn on the news, before I reach for the iPad and open up the mail is beginning to bear fruit. Or perhaps the leaves are just budding out. The blossoms and fruit are for later. I can begin to grasp the possibility. It gives me hope."
485,2019-06-09 08:36:40,2,"I’m about to delete your app. There is so many other apps that can do the same job with more free options or even lower prices. I’ve been a calm user for 5 years or so? I’m not sure at this point, and I’ve loved the app. It was great to finally get a good nights sleep. But it started getting popular, and I was even fine when the 2-3 free stories would change so one could get a variety even without paying. And you may never listen to the same story again, but I could live with that. Now, you only get one free story and NO free music. That’s it. Out of the Hundreds of songs and stories you get one. Or else you have to pay a monthly/yearly subscription for the rest. It’s stupid. I used to love calm, not it’s just a waste of space on my phone."
486,2018-05-17 06:19:48,5,"This app has literally changed my life. I am a recovering heroin addict and the lessons that each and every meditation teach me are exactly what I need to hear on each subject. If you are considering making a change in your life, whether sobriety or a divorce or anything else you may have going on, this app will change your life if you apply it. I use it each and everyday sense the day that I purchased it. There is a free edition that you can try, but I promise you if you want this to guide you as it has me then you will want the purchased app. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to my continuing sobriety at calm. You guys are amazing!!"
487,2019-11-25 15:01:55,5,"This app isn’t necessary to do this. However, its organization and design help. Tamara’s soothing voice (in my opinion) is optimally designed to help you achieve a state of calm and quiet where all the answers are found. 

We all psd way eventually. Do you really want to get to that point in your journey nd look back longingly because you left something dormant that ultimately you wanted to address? This app has helped me single out all the little corners of my psychological closet that needed cleaning or had an article of clothing I really needed to wear (proudly). 

I love the me this app helped me become and continues to help me nurture."
488,2020-07-24 07:49:03,3,"Music is often stressful for me, or agitates me, so the inability to turn it off in stories makes those sleep stories useless to me. And I sometimes need a while to fall asleep 20/30 min is not enough. A loop function or ability to build a playlist is a feature I really need in a sleep app.

 
I have another app that both allows me to turn off (or control the volume separately) background sounds and music, and to loop my story. I ended up canceling Calm for the other app. I have Calm again because my phone plan gave me a year free, but I never use it because of the missing features. But the other app has more features, and better functionality for half the price. Step it up Calm!"
489,2019-10-07 03:30:55,5,I used to enjoy this very expensive app but the new design makes it impossible to navigate. I can’t find the table of contents for the life of me. Nothing is labeled except with cryptic images. Instead of calming. It’s actually agitating and upsetting. Pushing what looks like a Home icon doesn’t bring you to a home page. All I want is to find the list of sleep story options or the list of background sounds to choose from or the timer to set but none of those can be found anymore. It seems like you’re given only on option. Unacceptable for the price we’re paying! FIX THIS APP NOW!!!
490,2018-11-05 04:54:08,5,"I think it was Winston Churchill who said “if you’re going through hell Keep Going!” Calm has kept me going! Calm is the best gift I’ve ever bought myself! It is a gold mine of mindful meditation instruction and technique and there are master classes taught by professionals in their field. I have tinnitus and now I keep soothing music or nature sounds going in the background during my quiet time and reading. More often than not I fall asleep listening to one of the many beautifully written and exquisitely read fiction or nonfiction bedtime stories. I simply cannot say enough about Calm so I will end by honestly saying, thank you Calm you have changed my life!"
491,2019-01-24 05:55:01,2,"I’ve been using this app for about a year to help my mind settle during bouts of severe insomnia. Even the limited meditations were beginning to help. I was so disappointed to open the app last night only to find that all of the music is now locked. I understand that app developers need to make money, but I cannot afford to pay for an app that gives me only an hours’ worth of music to relax me at night. I can find full albums of similar music to download for far less money. I hate to give such a negative review, because I honestly really enjoyed this app, even if the free version offered a limited selection. Please bring back the free content, or at least offer a “light” version of the app for free."
492,2017-11-02 04:40:16,5,"This is by far the best app of any I’ve ever used and I’ve used many. I’ve had my share of ups and downs in life. Though I’m a successful working professional, I’ve had professional therapy many times. I have significant anxiety issues that have  made me physically ill in the past. I use this app every day and I love it. The meditations are practical, are based on sound professional advice and are so helpful in just about every aspect of life. It has truly helped me stay grounded. I use it all the time and I’ve gifted it to many of my friends. They’ve all loved it. And the sleep stories are the icing on the cake. Well worth every penny!!!!"
493,2018-06-19 03:21:20,4,"I have had the free version of this app for some time now and genuinely enjoy it. The stories are nice for someone like me: I have trouble completely shutting my brain off at night, but I don’t want to listen to an audio book (for fear of losing my place), and I don’t want to sleep with the television on. The stories are relatively short and meant to get you gently from paying attention, to not really processing, to sleep. 

The only issue I am having is that I can’t find the monthly auto-renew option in the App Store. I have already signed up for the free trial and I just don’t know if I want to commit to $60 right this second. Calm - can you offer any help here? 

Thanks so much!"
494,2018-02-02 07:53:06,3,"The app is great, I love the nature sounds and the guided meditation. I was excited to see how many of them were free. I have severe anxiety and depression, I’m in college and I stay stressed. I have no money and I thought it was nice that these guys are on my side. However, I’m incredibly disappointed that all of the ones that show as free, only the first day out of the seven is free. So I’m not going to get nearly as much help from the app as I was hoping, being that I can’t afford $60 a year for everything else. The collections that show as free should BE FREE. All of the ones marked as premium I know I can’t get. But when I start a collection not marked as such, I was expecting to be able to finish it. Instead, I feel cheated out of it."
495,2020-08-14 00:42:33,5,"I recently decided to cancel my yearly subscription thinking I wasn’t using the app enough to justify keeping it and also wanted to try another meditation app. After cancelling, I started looking around for other apps and just kept coming back to Calm. The additions of The Spark and Masterclasses have added value for when I don’t necessarily want to meditate, but still want to be mindful. And I love Calm music for focusing at work. (I don’t use the Sleep Stories, but maybe one day...) Hope they keep coming out with a variety of options. My subscription ends in a few weeks, but then I’ll just be renewing 😃."
496,2019-12-20 02:48:55,5,"In all honesty, first time I downloaded the app I dismissed it right away as I didn’t think listening to someone read a book or hearing the sound of a jungle will actually “calm” you down and help you sleep but I did keep the app around. Anyways, A couple of days ago after spending 2 hours banging my head trying to sleep with no drowsiness insight I decided to give the app a go. After selecting one of the nature sounds (I still believe someone’s voice will be too distracting to help) I laid the phone next to me, listened for a couple of minutes then woke up the next day. Thanks you for this app."
497,2020-04-09 05:32:10,4,I really enjoy the app in the ambience it starts and with headphones it really is calming. I use this mainly for sleep and I love listening to the stories. The reason why I’m not continuing my subscription is because the stories are short and I don’t fall asleep. I know that sounds bad and like (what can you do) but it would be nice if Calm had a queue option where you could put a few sleep stories in line to play. It was less... “calming” to not fall asleep and then have to struggle with the menu to return back and try to find another sleep story.  I like the quality of the stories and hope there is more fiction like ones in the future so maybe I’ll revisit!
498,2018-06-26 03:26:01,5,"I have been taking Benadryl to sleep every night for years- otherwise I would lie awake with my mind reeling night after night. I asked my doctor for a prescription sleep aid- and she recommended this app. I am so glad she did! I am almost using no sleep aids anymore and the meditation is starting to help in every day life to be mindful. I have less anxiety now too. I love the sleep stories. Just enough interest to get my mind off the stress and listen to the story, but boring and calm enough to put me right to sleep. This is great. It’s expensive at $60, but averages out around $5/month? and the benefits are totally worth it to me."
499,2018-03-24 06:01:11,4,"I have been using this app every day for six months and LOVE it. After I did the latest update a couple days ago, none of the meditations will play and none of the meditations will download. When you hit play it just sits there, then when you exit out, the completion pop up appears and the meditation (that never even played) counts towards your meditation streak, rendering the data useless. The only meditation that will play is the Daily Calm from the homepage. I’m on an iPhone X, all updated. I hope this helps the developers fix it and get it pushed to its playing customers in the next day or else I will have to download a different app. I don’t want to!"
500,2018-03-02 20:47:06,5,"As a law student, this app has been my lifeline. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, and school has me so busy that I don’t have a chance to see friends, run, or do yoga—or any other destressers for that matter. I’ve been doing one meditation per lunch break for the last few weeks and I already feel myself able to cope with the constant competition and pressure in a whole new and effective way. The sleep stories are amazing as well, finally a way to fall asleep without dreaming of the lists of things I have to do (and without having to resort to looking at my phone screen/tv before bed to do so). Thank you, Calm 🙌🏽"
501,2018-01-13 22:39:46,5,"I have years of experience with meditation (even so, I’m no expert, there is always something new to learn!), so when this app was suggested to me by someone I know, I kind of rolled my eyes and thought “well, they really have an app for everything now!” Curiosity got me to try the app out. I’m very glad I did. There are many features on this app, for beginners and for those more experienced with meditation. I especially love that it is fully functional without paying for the membership. That way, those with a tighter budget can still benefit from what this app has to offer. Thank you to the developers for a great app!"
502,2017-09-20 10:23:28,5,"I didn't realize it but I've been having anxiety/panic attacks the past year or so.    For some unknown reason I will get incredibly anxious for no obvious reason.   I've been flying as a passenger for 20 years and all the sudden I had an incredible fear to board a flight or to stay on the plane    I've almost jumped off the plane before they close the door 3 or 4 times now.      When I have that feeling start to come over me I find a seat at the airport, but ok my headphones and listen to a session and I'm a whole new person. It forces me to take some time to be still and quiet and calm down.     I'm incredibly thankful for this app."
503,2020-10-30 09:25:01,5,"I can’t say enough about Calm, in fact everyone who knows me knows that I swear by Calm more than once daily to enable me to focus, control emotions, and have also seen my personal relationships and career develop beyond what I thought was possible. Tamara is my favorite next to Cillian Murphy, but I have to say there isn’t any session I haven’t fully enjoyed. If there was a lifetime membership I would do it. This journey has changed the way I view everything in my life. Especially during the pandemic and political and social issues this year has brought. I’m so much more grounded. Thank you Calm and everyone who invests in this!!!"
504,2021-02-20 15:30:07,1,"I’ve never written a review in my life, probably because I’ve never been so disappointed about a product that I love so much (should be loved). It’s been a week plus since the latest update came out, that’s ample time to fix or go back one update to where a higher volume of your customers had access. Yes, in the past there was the occasional issue (once a month, if that), but nothing like this where the screen is stuck on “take a deep breath.” I like so many have been a subscriber for several years and have used Calm religiously every night (it allowed to get off of sleep-aid medication), but now I am having to find other means to fall asleep. If you don’t hurry up and fix the app, you may be losing another longtime customer who has praised you and promoted you several times over!!"
505,2021-02-04 05:52:51,3,"Honestly, I am surprised at the exorbitant cost I am paying for this app considering the few times I use it a month. That being said, those few times a month it is totally worth it and definitely puts me to bed. I’m in a sales role, high stress, corporate job and this app helps me wind down and go to bed. 

Why I hate Tamara Levitt- She has to be one of the most narcissistic persons on the planet. I hate her VOICE, I hate how much she loves her own voice, she sounds scripted, I hate how breathy she is, I hate that she doesn’t leverage other people for meditations. Here’s an idea Tamara, not everyone wants to hear you! For the love of God, get over yourself and find other people/ other voices so I can get some better rest and pay $100 to get some rest."
506,2018-03-22 11:07:22,5,"But watch out for the automatic renewal thing, theres no warning for your subscription renewal, only emails you get are if you dont have a card on your account and theres no way for your subscription to renew you only get those right after you purchase your subscription. Ive paid $40 now in 3 months because of the stupid renewal thing. I tried to update my itunes account so i could get the year subscription but when i added my card this app automatically charged me without asking if i wanted to renew or change my subscription and thats pretty crappy if you ask me."
507,2018-03-22 03:34:04,5,"I’ve had horrible panic attacks that wake me in the middle of sleep every night for a long time now. Over the past few months they have gotten worse. In a last ditch effort before going to medication I decided to give meditation a try... this app is amazing!! In the first night using the 7 days of sleep program I actually slept through the night for the first time in months! Now I feel more rested and focused throughout the day, and I feel like I have some control in my life. Anyone who is struggling with sleep or anxiety or stress I HIGHLY recommend using this app!! Thank you Calm!!!"
508,2018-01-09 11:27:00,5,"If you have a hard time managing stress and anxiety, like so many other people, I HIGHLY recommend this app. I use the free version and it’s excellent. I’ve never been someone who meditates. I have a hard time focusing and after only a couple weeks (albeit inconsistently) I’ve finally come around to the benefits of taking those extra 5, 10, 15 minutes each morning to relax and before bed to ease me into sleep. Give it a try! If you use nothing else, the calming sounds and landscapes they have are beautiful and nice to listen to while falling asleep. :)"
509,2017-08-31 02:56:36,5,"I don't ever say that, but it's true. This is the best choice I've ever made. Saw an ad on Facebook and remembered being told how healthy and incredible meditation was for the human body. However I didn't know the first thing about it. From the first session, I was hooked. I've never gotten as good of sleep as when I meditate before bed and my focus has gotten so much better. Plus, I feel better and healthier after just the first day! I love the rain on leaves background. Sometimes I open the app just to listen to it and watch it. This app is incredible and worth whatever amount of money you put into it!"
510,2021-02-19 13:11:13,5,"I started out using the free version of Calm, which actually had a lot of things I liked. When I found myself using it more often, I paid the year subscription price. I’ve been using it for about 3 years now, and I still use it very often. While there are many excellent daily meditations, I confess I mostly use it for relaxation in the evenings and for sleep. The playlists, as well as the sleep stories, help me relax and fall asleep quickly. I also use the scenes when I’m working from home as they’re a nice visual to break up the monotony of being at my desk alone all day."
511,2020-08-19 10:07:48,5,"so i’m in love with harry styles... and honestly this is a BLESSING. i’ve been having trouble sleeping because of my severe anxiety and depression disorder, and panic attacks. thoughts of cutting keep me awake. it’s very gets bad and i’m only a teenager. this is helping everything. i’ve never fallen asleep so fast and he tells the perfect story that puts you to sleep in at least 10 minutes. and that’s never happened to me before! all you have to do is succumb to his voice and do whatever he tells you to. i swear, if you’re a styler, harrie, or directioner, you will LOVE this because it feels like he’s in the room. it’s amazing! totally recommend this!"
512,2021-02-09 06:53:50,3,"So I just got this app because I have trouble falling asleep sometimes, and I got this in hopes to help with that. However when I got on the app I couldn’t really find anything that was free witch is kinda disappointing seeing as there are so many grate reviews, I understand why everything costs but it would be nice to at least have a few songs that are free so I know what I would be paying for or if I didn’t have money to spend on the app. In short  I did see some ads covering this app and it did seem like a really good app I just wish there were at least 1 or 2 free songs for the people who couldn’t afford to spend the money or who just wanted to see how things were before spending money."
513,2017-11-07 13:36:49,5,"I’ve tried one or two other meditation apps and find Calm the best. I especially like the voice of the woman who directs each meditation and the writing. The pieces are thoughtful and simple to follow at the same time. They don’t get in the way. Each day there is a new ten-minute meditation that will end with a short takeaway and quote intended to help take the calm of mindfulness off the mat/chair/cushion into the day. I have tried the sleep recordings and they are not for me. They must be intended to bore you to sleep, but they just annoyed me awake. But the daily meditations and meditation series (7 days of managing stress, etc) are very well done."
514,2020-06-19 10:23:51,2,"I very much dislike how everything is for premium hardly will I ever find a story and I can’t even find music without having to buy a premium pass. This app is overwhelming me instead of calming me, I can’t find good music, I can barely find any stories, hardly is anything available. What if some people don’t have money? What if they downloaded this app to calm them because of that reason? People probably get anxiety more from this app than from curing it because they thought that they will have no app that will actually calm them without buying a premium pass. It’s ridiculously overwhelming me with how much I COULD HAVE read and listened too but I couldn’t because of you guys going over the line with this premium pass. There’s no hate I’m just giving you a word of advice."
515,2020-01-16 13:09:17,4,"Content wise this app is wonderful, however one of the main people whose voice is on many of the guided meditations (one of the primary advantages this app had over others was both the sleep sound/stories and guided meditations) does not work well for me. Unfortunately, through no fault of their own, some voices are grating to certain people. There are a variety of other readers, so I am still happy over all. It is just unfortunate, and had I noticed how frequently this one person was used, I would likely have spent my money elsewhere. Definitely get a thorough sampling before you commit. If you find that this isn’t an issue for you, Calm is wonderful."
516,2019-05-08 22:42:27,2,"I’ll bet that you don’t get a review like this often, but I am a blind person that has been trying to find an accessible meditation app, and while some of your features are accessible with blind users screen readers, many of them are not, and the buttons are not labeled, and therefore we do not know what it is that we are selecting. With just a little bit of work, and with a few changes, I can tell that your app has much potential to become accessible for blind users, but unfortunately is not quite there yet. If this app does end up becoming more user-friendly for the blind in the future, I will be more than glad to raise my rating on your app at that point when I am able to start using it in its entirety."
517,2017-09-21 15:32:18,5,"I'm a regular blue collar construction worker, so I'm not much for the ""whoo-whoo"". However, this app has helped me overcome (or should I say accept) many difficult situations, from anxiety to a slump, or even anger towards difficult coworkers, restlessness etc, etc,. If you got five minutes at break time; take a quick mental vacation that will help you restart the day on a good foot! Sometimes, it's not feasible or appropriate to go for a jog, hit the heavy bag, or sit in the lotus position while chanting a mantra. With this app, I simply throw on the head phones at break, relax, reset, and reboot! It's better than drugs, because it's cheaper, lasts longer, and won't get me fired! Powerful!"
518,2017-09-26 01:11:26,4,"And this app has added an extra layer of happiness/CALMNESS that I've never experienced. The ladies voice is so soothing and calm, i feel as though I've been cleansed by the end of the short sessions. Currently on the 21 days of Calmness and I can say without a doubt, this app is for anyone suffering from traumatic brain injuries, CTE, concussions. All of which I've dealt with while playing football from 6th grade all the way to 5 years in the #NFL. 
I am so happy this is a part of my daily routine to recovery! ❤️
**need to fix the end screen where you write about your session! 
you write too much and the page doesn’t move and you can’t see what you’re writing!! Fix please!!"
519,2021-02-11 18:25:31,5,"I started using Calm as a Respiratory Therapist when COVID hit.
I didn’t know how to deal with what I was experiencing at work, fearing for my life or bringing it home to my family, and the politics that said it wasn’t happening.
I took Calm to the restroom at work because a break isn’t always possible when needed and listen for two or three minutes and learn to follow my breath, hear the waves on a shore, or rain falling and take my body sensations that were responding to my negative thoughts to a better place.
At home I started going to sleep with Calm.
Thank you to ALL who are behind the scenes and in front at Calm."
520,2020-12-26 10:35:56,5,"My husband started using calm on a rec from a friend, & it took a lot of encouragement for me to see a need to create space for quiet & stillness in my life. The creators of calm deliver these meditations in a way that’s not cheesy, and the daily recommendations make it easy to form the valuable habit. The addition of fresh music content, and other growth content, aside from the mediations, is also top notch, with new stuff added all the time. The idea of meditation can see intimidating to a lot of people, but calm delivers it in a way that anyone can access. I have and will continue to recommend Calm. Thank you."
521,2019-10-07 21:01:02,5,"I disabled the auto-renewal while trying the 7-day trial of the Calm. Somehow I was still charged ~$70 for the annual subscription. I couldn't get a refund and I didn't use the app out of spite for some time.

I don't think it can replace my favorite mediation instructor and App - Waking Up by Sam Harris. Calm is not just for meditation however. I've been exploring the focus, sleep, and ""themed"" meditations and been enjoying them so far.

I think this App deserves a 5-star review for it's content, but I'm still bothered by the fact they use an opt-out basis for sneakily charging you. It's a bit obnoxious to say the least."
522,2020-11-17 20:58:39,3,"I have a paid subscription and while I’d give 5 stars for the content, as it is incredible, I’m so turned off by Tamara’s voice and that alone brings down my rating. 

Some meditations do have other speakers and they’re all wonderful, however too many feature Tamara’s voice and she’s pretty difficult to avoid.  Regrettably, I’m not able to tolerate her voice at all, it cuts into my zen vibe like a needle scratching a record, and instantly brings about levels of anger that all the deep breathing I can muster can’t extinguish. 

I’ll have to stick with Headspace once my Calm subscription ends. But if voices change at Calm before my subscription ends, I do prefer their programming over Headspace and would be happy to stay."
523,2020-04-03 00:55:22,4,I enjoy your app. But I have a few suggestions on making the app better for people who cannot get the premium. I think you should make more stories available without having to buy the premium. I cannot buy the premium. So I look for unlocked stories that I don’t have to pay for and there are only like two or three stories that I can listen to out of the 30. I really love this app. And I appreciate that it has been made. But if  a app is going to be made it should be able to be used from people that can’t afford to pay for the premium. Thanks for listing to my suggestions and I hope you make some changes.
524,2019-04-25 23:27:48,5,"Calm has been such a help for me, I really can’t say enough.  Especially since they have added the Master Classes, the Sleep Stories and they just continually strive to improve.  It’s not an app that sells you a “gimmick” and takes your $$, then runs!  The quality is top-notch.  I have especially utilized the function which allows you to pull up your user history, so that I can return to meditations that I found most insightful.  I also find myself sharing with others about my positive experiences with the app and doing mini “info mercials” for Calm sessions or features.  LOL- I may as well be on staff.  Thanks, CALM!"
525,2018-11-24 18:07:32,5,"I’ve been meditating for years and love the Calm app for guided sessions on the go (in waiting rooms, on the subway, even when stopped in traffic). But what really makes this app better than the rest is the Kids section in Sleep Stories. It’s become part of the kids’ bedtime routine to choose a sleep story, cozy up in their beds, and fall asleep listening to gentle children’s stories like The Velveteen Rabbit or Rapunzel or The Nutcracker. (Sometimes, if I’m cuddling with one of the kids, I’ll fall asleep myself and have to force myself out of the nest an hour later.) Such an easy way to get my kiddos to settle down and ready for sleep!"
526,2018-07-31 13:30:12,5,"In my life I was very tense I was very stressed and depressed and I tried calm and for the first time in my life I was still heartbroken from past memories but I was looking forward to the future and starting to love myself and enjoy the present I feel better than I ever was ever in my life i’m not saying it repairs you of how you feel if it’s depression or anger but I’m just saying it helps you Control it and be at peace with yourself and your past and your future and the world I say try Calm and if you don’t like it you can always delete it but trust me I don’t think you won’t 

Make a better today and a better future 😘"
527,2018-11-09 18:26:38,1,"I have had Calm for a couple of years now and most of the features music, stories, mindfulness etc now cost?! This was my favorite app until all the unexpected fees. There was one song that would literally bring my spirt up no matter the circumstances and I would listen to it for hours on end. And I for the life of me have been trying to find it! Now you can’t even just pick a song, just one song for free and it’s quite upsetting now. I feel as though having the app for the years I’ve had it I could have at least kept my content. I would’ve deleted it but the only reason I haven’t is because, when you open the app it just plays one random song and you can’t even view it. This review would normally be receiving a 5 star but this is the reason I feel it deserves 1 star!"
528,2018-05-01 05:06:55,5,"I’m very grateful for becoming a part of the CalmCommunity!! I have incorporated mindful meditation into my nearly daily routine and I am very aware of the vast benefits it brings. I allow myself to make the 10 minutes a way to attain a level of peace I believe I am not only deserving but also capable of attaining within those 10 minutes. It is that powerful and everybody can also attain the same by simply following the guide’s instructions and be open to the benefits themselves. I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants a respite for themselves. Good fortune to you and thank you Tamara Levit for your powerful guidance. Thank you Calm, too!!"
529,2017-10-30 06:23:48,5,"I've had this app for almost two years. I was hesistant in purchasing an annual subscription since there were several free meditation apps available. However, this was the only app that I felt comfortable with. Prior to this app, I had a nervous breakdown. I had gotten out of an emotionally abusive relationship and I hated being angry of my past and fearful of my future. I wanted to be free of my anxiety. Although, I still struggle with anxiety, doubt and depression, I truly believe this app was one of the best investment I've made for my mental well being. Thank you, Calm for adding value and direction into my life."
530,2017-08-23 11:30:10,5,"I struggle with an anxiety disorder and find that mindfulness meditation helps. But if you're having anxiety, racing thoughts, etc., it's exceedingly difficult to do without a guide. I've taken classes at a local hospital and got recordings from the facilitators. I've also tried several other meditation apps. This is WAY better. The voices are actually pleasant and calming, which is really important. You can adjust the time of several meditations, change background sounds, etc. it's packed with lots of different kinds of meditations for different purposes. And the sleep stories are fantastic!"
531,2020-04-26 11:05:35,5,I often had sleep anxiety where my mind would race through thoughts and embarrassing moments from my entire life making it impossible to fall asleep. I wouldn’t look forward to going to sleep. also would keep the tv on for some irrational fear of the dark. Now I can gladly say all of that is gone thanks to calm’s bed time stories. I fall asleep in less than 20 minutes and I’m so excited to go to bed now. This app has been truly life changing. I’ve gotten similar results by listening to podcasts but it’s just not the same. I highly recommend Calm for the sleep stories alone :)
532,2020-09-17 11:35:43,2,"Overall, this is great only on the outside. The app is charming and visually pleasing, but it’s heavily commercialized as they bring in famous people to attract more customers and the content is so limited and definitely not worth the hefty price of $70 annually! You’d expect something exceptional for that price, that you’d otherwise not find on other online sources. But trust me, I found much better content on YT and for free. Podcasts are way too short and limited, sleep stories are fine if you are a fan of a certain celebrity, mood check-in is useless, as it does no personalization of the content for you. Calm body has only about 6 excercises. It’s unrealistic to charge this much for such limited amount of content. Price should be more reasonable."

534,2018-06-12 22:30:45,5,"I have anxiety, depression, and ptsd. Often I stay awake all night, then can’t get out of bed all day. It’s been crippling and ongoing for most of my life. I can honestly say it’s been over a decade since I’ve had a healthy and sound night of sleep, and I’ve never fallen asleep in less than an hour. Last night was my 5th night of Sleep Stories. I fell asleep deeply each night only minutes into each story. I woke up each morning naturally by 8am feeling refreshed. I never knew what this could feel like. I’m so impressed. No nightmares/night terrors, no tossing and turning, no constant waking up. I slept soundly. Thank you."
535,2018-12-04 08:21:57,2,"I’m willing to change the rating but first some kinks need to be worked out. I have really bad anxiety especially when I’m home alone trying to go to bed. The sleep stories on calm really calm me down and allow me to sleep 200x better. However, my main problem is there’s only one sleep story and nothing else no music, asmr, or anything that’s available to me on the free version, there’s really only so many times I can listen to the same thing and still fall asleep. I’d really love to see more available to those that can’t afford to pay for the premium version of the app but still love the app. Because this really does help with my anxiety it just makes me sad that there’s so many limits to the app because it helps so much!"
536,2017-09-16 18:30:28,5,"I've been using this app for a few days now. Definitely considering putting my money into it! Everything about this is amazing! My body feels soft, relaxed, and almost renewed after each session I've taken so far! I'm a college student and I experience anxiety, stress, and loads of trouble with sleeping. This app is helping me with all of these, including staying focused and to just breathe and relax. The sleep stories are my favorite! I'll lay in bed and turn on a sleep story and close my eyes, next thing you know I'm becoming more relaxed and I always fall asleep soundly right after! Wonderful app for sure!"
537,2017-09-25 12:12:13,3,"The only reason I gave it three stars instead of five is that the program upgrade to go to the next level is excessive in cost.  That is disappointing because I would like to stay with it but won't for that price. $13/mo., $5.mo for a yr, or $300. Lifetime!!😳 Would like to see them reconsider their prices.  
Overall, I have found this guided meditation series very helpful.  The free service is a basic short beginners process.  I enjoy that you can play the nature sounds and music on top of the guided meditation.  It helps with relaxation.  I wish there was a Christian app that would do the same thing. I also really like the sleep stories. In just a weeks time my sleep has significantly improved."
538,2017-08-23 14:10:04,5,"I've only been using Calm for about 6 weeks and am already completely amazed by how Tamara and her team's daily suggestions, encouragements and points of focus have so positively impacted my thought process and overall emotional and physical well being.

Four of the fundamental key lessons I've learned (mindfulness, non-judgmental thinking of self/others/thoughts/etc, carrying less ""weight"" in life, always returning to the breath), among the countless others, are already changing my life for the better day by day by day - just incredible.

There's always more to learn about mindful meditation and yourself every day..."
539,2021-02-17 13:27:49,5,"I noticed the benefits of the Calm app almost immediately. I usually start self-improve activities and do not feel like continuing with the program or process. With Calm it’s different: I look forward to the next session. I was feeling very apathetic, negative, and stressed; within 2 minutes, that energy and thoughts transformed. I even went back to journaling.  I highly recommend the app Calm, even if it costed thousands of dollars a year. Life is priceless. Calm is bringing me back to life, a wonderful, positive, Blissful and happy life. Thanks and Blessings to the people that created Calm; it’s a gift for humanity and the world."
540,2020-12-23 14:11:18,5,"Although for years I was a firm believer in the power of meditation, I had drifted from it. Looking at Instagram last night I came across a post from Calm and decided to give their free trial a try. My experience this morning was beyond amazing. As the meditation began, my body was physically hit with an pleasant and exciting energy I can only describe as spiritual lightning. Some people call it chicken skin!  I feel energized, more focused and happier. I can truly say I am more ready to face my day after spending ten minutes in meditation this morning. The Calm app made this experience easily accessible and I look forward to more."
541,2020-10-28 06:36:11,5,"I suffer from insomnia... This app is great for so many reasons. At first, I only listened to the 'rain' which is automatically on when you open the app. But then I started listening to the music on here for bedtime and I was in love. I'm super excited to listen to the other topics. I've fav'ed a few, including the new solo guitar track. 
Joined when Amex gave me one complimentary year, wanted to try it for multiple reasons and I was intrigued... Never heard of it before. So happy with this app that I think I might just pay for the annual subscription😳 lol who knew?! Thank you for this app! Was truly needed💯"
542,2020-12-08 16:27:01,2,"First I wanna say that the Daily Calms are so AWESOME. Really love the body scans. Tamara’s voice is so peaceful and beautiful. Some things that could be improved: the search functionality needs some work: when you type “3 minute meditation” the results shown are meditation for little kids. It’s a little annoying finding an old meditation that you favorite cuz there’s no way to organize them in different categories so it feels you are mixing up apples with oranges, and when I wake up and need to play something to help me to go back to sleep I spend so much time trying to find the one I’m looking for, and it’s totally the opposite of what I’m expecting to happen at 3 am in the morning and end up feeling frustrated for something I’m paying for."
543,2020-08-01 21:43:50,5,"This is an absolute MUST have for anyone, even if you do think you have it all together and you don’t feel stressed, anxious, or depressed. Anyone and everyone can benefit from the power of medication. The Calm app has seriously changed my entire perspective on life and how I cope with stress, confusion, anxiety, and anger. And above all, it has increased my love and happiness with myself and with others. I no longer let every day frustrations get the best of me. Calm has truly helped me become a better human; emotionally and physically, more than any medication or therapist has. I highly recommend this app! 11/10"
544,2020-10-14 05:15:16,3,"I downloaded this app one day after an extremely stressful day at work. I knew that there were a lot of paywalls, but I wanted to give the free stuff a try. I managed to find a few free 7-day stress relief sessions, and instantly felt better. This app really works!
Then I came home the next day, almost as stressed as the day before. As soon as I got home, I was so excited to continue the sessions I started, only to find out that the rest of the sessions were locked behind a paywall! Forget stress-relief. The app suddenly added stress!  I understand that they want people to subscribe, but then why even bother with having such little free stuff at all? Just stick with the “7-day trial” and leave it at that."
545,2020-04-16 11:11:16,5,"During these crazy times, it is well worth the under $10/month fee to give yourself some grounding. I always humored the idea of meditation but didn’t know how to go about it. This app provides an escape like no other - approximately 10 minutes a day is all you need, but you can do more! And at any time of day. This is helping me get through a very scary time. Mental health is so important!!! I love all the different profile “scenes”, the different music, and all the resources this app provides. If you’re an anxious person and a meditation-virgin, I recommend this app wholeheartedly. You deserve it."
546,2019-10-17 08:41:34,5,"My little sister had huge problems falling asleep at night, she would lay awake for hours tossing and turning, now that I have calm she falls asleep within one to two sleep stories!!!!! I love the background sounds. I was skeptical of meditation in the beginning, being a Christian and all, but it has greatly helped me in my every day life, my stress level has gone down, and now it even helps with when I’m in pain I can breath and relax my body and it help lessen the pain and/or dissolve it complete!!!! My focus has improved as well and I’m learning how too use and take control of my mind!!! Thank you calm!!!!!!"
547,2020-01-18 17:53:20,3,"I like this app a lot but they’ve added so many different series to it that now it’s too much. It’s like they threw the whole kitchen sink of anything they might slightly deal with mindfulness into the app. I wish they would pare it down and I would also find it useful to mark a whole series as a favorite not just one session. That way if I’m doing 21 days of calm, it doesn’t help if I mark day 7 as a favorite when I really just want get to day 8 easily the next day, but if I could make the whole series a favorite that would help. Again, there’s so much loaded into the app now it’s hard to find things and it’s hard to decide which one you should even do or that would be most helpful to you."
548,2018-03-18 13:11:46,5,"I discovered this app being advertised on Facebook last year and loved it instantly! Since than I have told multiple people to use it and they are all benefiting from it. Recently, a friend told me she started listening to the story to help her fall asleep. She suffers from chronic migraine and always had difficulty falling asleep. No medication would help her. She would never be able to sleep before 2am and her maximum sleep would be only 4 hours. She started playing the story in the app. And soothing tone is helping her fall asleep instantly! By recommending Calm to her I was able to help change her life. Thank you"
549,2019-03-07 04:29:55,4,"Calm is a great App that helps me a lot.
The one thing that is SO frustrating is the OVER use of Tamara Levitt’s  voice for so much of the content.  I’m sure her voice works for many people,  but it is extremely annoying to me and I am so confused as to why they would only offer her voice on about 75 percent of the content on this App. This App is very expensive and it should offer much more if a selection of narrators. I understand that she writes the content but please her voice on all the meditations is ridiculous. It’s seems like  a real contradiction to what the App should be promoting.  PLEASE provide a VARIETY of voices CALM!  Let’s have diversity just like the sleep stories."
550,2018-07-09 11:40:04,2,"The Calm app is so awesome because each session (like in 21 days of calm) is a learning opportunity as well as a guided meditation. Two in one. So I learn a single concept to focus on that I try to keep in mind the rest of the day. I used to read books about meditation and practice on my own. It was a project!  Time consuming. And I’d forget things I read too.  Too many concepts at once without time to reflect. With Calm I learn insightful concepts and ways of thinking, but little by little so it works into my way of being and sticks better. Also guided meditation helps pull my wondering mind back much better than I do on my own. And the guide is so forgiving and compassionate about my wondering mind that I find meditation pleasant rather than frustrating like before."
551,2017-12-15 18:19:52,5,"Really enjoying the free trial. After a few days I decided I will be paying for the subscription when the 30 day trial is over. Anyone complaining about the price doesn't value peace of mind and sleep, a subscription of sleeping pills or anxiety medication would cost more than $15/month. I would like to know how often they add new stories. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and start another sleep story and 9/10 times I'm sleeping before it ends. Really enjoying this app, so glad I've found it. 
Nothing in life is free and this app provides a wonderful variety of mind calming processes. Worth it."
552,2021-01-23 17:32:06,5,"Last Night I used Calm app’s “story” feature for falling to sleep. First of all, I was easily relaxed by the voice of the reader. It was soothing without sounding ridiculously forced as are those of the many other apps I have tried. 
    I wasn’t sure I’d find a story relaxing, because in my other attempts, I have tried meditations which have sounded like hypnosis sessions, and nature sounds that awakened my alarm sensors over worrisome storms.
     For me, my first try was well worth the  apps cost. Since I found Calm useful, I may keep the app. $60 a year feels outrageous. However, it is, after all, pennies a day ....zzzz"
553,2021-02-14 11:51:05,4,"Meditation isn’t something I was super familiar with before I bought this app, but a therapist, in conjunction with some books I read, suggested that I try it. Now, I won’t go a day without meditating in the morning. It’s how I start my day, and it’s an integral part of my well-being. The journaling aspect is invaluable, and I have recommended this app to countless friends and family members. The only thing I would suggest to the developers is to allow the music portion (new music by Keith Urban is 👏🙌👌🏽) to be played outside the app, so that when I’m checking e-mail, making dinner or using another app, the music still plays in the background."
554,2020-06-04 07:45:35,5,"Generally speaking I love the app and use it virtually everyday.

However, the last few updates are causing the app to not recognize my downloads. That is, the downloads section in settings says I have 62 meg downloaded but the actual downloads section in the main app where I select the item to listen to, in this case a sleep story, says I've not downloaded anything yet.

This is a real hassle because now I have to go and search to find the item I want to listen to every night instead of just going to the downloads section and clocking on the item and listening.

If I delete the app and reinstall the app the downloads are listed again without me actually redownloading anything. This tells me the app is getting messed up reach time an update is installed.

This is starting to get old. Renewal is coming up and I may just skip it and try another app. There are plenty out there. I like this app though so I'm hoping this gets fixed."
555,2020-11-30 09:12:21,3,"I’ve had this app since 2017 and absolutely loved it. I have some nights where it’s horribly difficult to fall asleep and the different sleep stories allowed me to wind down really well. Now that I’m in college, my stress has gotten worse and my nights have become way long and calm no longer helps because it’s the same single sleep story that I have available to me. It’s really such a shame that this has turned into a money juicer rather than the lovely helpful app that it was. If lowering the cost isn’t an option, at least make more of the stories, meditations, and plans available. At the very least the daily calm. Love the app, just don’t have enough use for it now."
556,2019-01-03 01:28:49,5,"If anybody has ever had a panic attack they know how debilitating it can be. I was going through one that lasted more than two hours and I was suffering greatly. I tried all the methods I know to get through it but it just kept getting worse. 

I had seen multiple ads on social media for Calm so I decided to try it. I chose a guided 12 minute program for stress and anxiety. Unbelievably my panic attack was gone at the end of the session.

I highly recommend Calm to anyone who has this condition. I can’t wait to try it out for other purposes like sleep, Focus and meditation"
557,2019-07-01 03:06:04,4,"Love the app! So far has helped me get through my life and also helps me fall asleep a lot quicker and faster 💨 I also love the backgrounds, music, sleep stories, and meditations!!! Sometimes I do wish that the daily calm was free  for everyone and the other meditations are for only calm premium but I understand that life doesn’t work that way and you can’t always get what you want, however I think that it will make people’s desire to have the app and use it daily increases because they will have a calm relaxing time with daily calm! 😌 Other than that I LOVE YOU GUYS APP AND I WISH YALL ALL THE BEST!!! Hope it becomes even more successful in the future than it already is!!!😘😁"
558,2019-05-28 07:45:16,1,"One would think since there appears to be two versions of Calm, one being Calm Premium, that this one is the free version, especially since it doesn’t ask for payment upon installing the app. However, as you go thru setup answering a handful of questions about what brought you to Calm and if you’re interested in and have tried meditation it then asks you for payment info informing you that it’s a free 7 day trial only before then charging you $70 for a year long subscription, which is the Calm Premium. Bait and switch is what I’d call this. Disappointing as I thought the app looked lovely and interesting after catching a commercial advertising for it on tv tonight. However, I’m not about to pay $70 for a subscription for an app when there are plenty of similar free apps and free resources."
559,2018-12-27 03:53:01,5,"I downloaded this app at the beginning of 2018 when I began refocusing on my overall wellness and stress management. This app isn’t cheap, but in the short time I’ve owned it, they have added SO much content! There are bedtime stories, guided meditations, music, nature sounds, etc. The Calm App even offers “master classes” that are like mini self improvement classes by some of my favorite authors. I have several other meditation/relaxation apps but Calm provides the most value and versatility. 

Shout out to the development team and content creators because this app never gets stale and continues to prove it’s worth!"
560,2017-12-20 08:19:41,5,"I commend the app creators for a stress-free interface, a meditation regime that is anything but regimented but just as effective, and a coach in Tamara Levitt that exudes humble wisdom. I know this review sounds a bit corny, but this is how I honestly feel. Not all answers are found in her guidance, but her gentle voice puts people on the path towards those answers. The compassion for others and the desire to help them thrive pours out from this app. And it’s okay to fail, to mess up or flub practice! That failure is not only accepted, but used as an excellent teaching tool to coach users on how best to handle failure. I have experienced few things in life that gentle."
561,2018-03-14 12:51:15,2,"I thought this was a free app and that it would have a good amount of options for free users, but they don’t. If you have the money to get all of the purchased contact which is about 3/4 of the app then I think you’re good. I wouldn’t know the extent to the purchased material and it was good or not, since I couldn’t afford it. However, if you’re a poor college student (or any other individual) who can’t or won’t pay, I would say get another app. Insight timer has LOADS of free content and I recommend that. The app itself is very pretty and eye appealing but that’s not going to help me with my anxiety when at least half the meditations are blocked until you pay. They really should advertise that more honestly."
562,2017-09-10 17:18:11,5,"Stressed out? - get Calm
Trouble sleeping? - get Calm
Looking for some motivation? - get Calm

I'm currently a student in professional school and Calm has helped me get through some very stressful times. I was new to meditation before getting the Calm app but meditating is now something I look forward to everyday. This app helps me manage my stress and ultimately just makes me feel happier throughout the day. 

I started using this app with just the free version just to check it out. I quickly found the benefits this app provided me in how it made me feel and bought a years subscription. Money well spent! 

Calm has all of its meditations organized so it's easy for the user to focus on exactly what he/she needs. From guided meditations for beginners on various subjects to meditations for kids, this app has everything one could ask for in order to feel calm.

The ambient sounds are extremely relaxing and Calm has an expansive selection to choose from. 

I highly highly recommend this app!!"
563,2017-09-07 13:52:31,5,"I have found this tool to be of great help in releasing my tension and effort to control. I'm a severe abuse survivor and have Lyme Condition in last stage, stage 3. It has effected my brain, energy, emotions, and at times alert and clear thinking. I'm really a miracle despite this condition. But do find this app more effective than reaching for a medication. It also enhances my spirituality and the learning and growth I am gaining into my spiritual being. Thanks for such a great tool for people to use to find the kind of freedom that letting everything truly ""go"" brings. That inner peace, joy, belief, and faith, that if one chooses, can draw one closer to the source of all Life."
564,2018-05-30 14:19:16,5,"If you are searching for guided meditations this is the app for you. I have enjoyed adding meditation to my daily schedule. The night stories are wonderful. It’s become a new routine in our house that I am very thankful for. 
I believe it is fairly priced for all that is offered. I typically meditate to the daily calm but can always go in and find a meditation that helps in moments of anxiety, arguments or just needing a moment. The walking medications are wonderful. There is something for everybody. Whether you meditate everyday or are incorporating something new into your life, Calm can help you center and bring calm to your life."
565,2020-12-28 21:11:28,2,"Lots of content—so much, there’s always something new. I’m happy to see a variety of voices, but wish there were (1) more voices if color in non-specialty meditations (meaning not just celebrities of color), and (2) more content and a greater variety of voices for Calm Kids, which my kid refuses to use because the voices are “too cutesy” and she feels condescended to. The biggest negative for me, though, is the rain sounds that come from my phone at totally random times of the day. Sometimes I unlock my phone and the sound is just there, and the app isn’t even open in the background. You can’t even just pause from the quick menu—I have to find the app, open it, then swipe up to the app selector and swipe again to force quit. That is annoying."
566,2020-06-04 15:25:00,2,"Downloaded this app and will be deleting after this review. It took me 10 seconds to realize you can’t use this app without spending money. EVERYTHING is LOCKED until they get your money and even then, you’ll run out of stories in a couple weeks. So unless you want to waste your money and have VERY limited content, don’t waste your time with this “app”. I’m really surprised at all the good reviews. There’s hardly any options or content and you run out of stories fast so you’ll have to listen to them over and over. The idea is good but you’ll use up this app and be done with it in 2 weeks. It’s definitely a cash grab app and could definitely be a whole lot better if they actually put some effort in this app."
567,2019-11-28 06:10:20,3,"To the developers of calm, I am an individual who has sleep problems and most on the time there is little to fix it, ever sconce I had found calm I have been trying to use it but to no avail, you see pretty much everything is locked behind a paywall which creates a problem, that problem is that I, along with the sleep problems, has other issues in my life, seeing that my sleep is locked behind a membership deeply troubles me, I would sincerely enjoy useing the app to its fullest as I have heard great things, maybe one suggestion if you limit the paywalls is to put ads in unobtrusive places that would generate a revenue from the people now useing calm,That is just a suggestion but thank you.

Sincerely: Ian F."
568,2018-08-16 05:29:18,3,"Wonderful app. I was thisclose to subscribing when an update wrecked my primary use of it. I know there's a sound fetish movement out there that includes a certain singsong vocal quality and whistling S sounds and so on, but the point of ""sleep stories"" is to fall asleep. The newly re-recorded stories are just awful - especially my former favorite, ""The Waterfall."" The whistling S's are like nails on a chalkboard. The exaggerated singsong might be good for a children's story but is highly distracting. And I notice the same thing has been done to ""Blue Gold"" now. Are the previous versions of these stories available to Premium subscribers? Are there any Premium sleep stories that don't have this fetish quality now?"
569,2018-02-23 02:22:08,5,"This app is wonderful. If you are wondering if an app is really appropriate for meditation and releasing stress because it requires the use of your “gadgets” that you may want to put down - I get where you are coming from!

...but think of an elegant app that you can open, and with a click or two get to a daily meditation or a wonderful sleep story and immediately set the phone or iPad down while listening... (and possibly streaming to your speakers). This is what the folks of Calm were thinking when they designed the app, and it works perfectly. 

So worth it! It is truly a joy to use."
570,2018-01-21 11:44:37,5,"In the 7.5 years I have had an iPhone, I have probably rated less than 20 apps and have written less than five reviews.  This app, I feel, is one of the best meditation resources out there.  Definitely the best for guided meditation.  I am a licensed therapist and I use this app almost every day, for myself, at the beginning of the day for a sense of calm and peace before the day begins.  I am highly impressed by the newest addition, Calm Masterclass, And am anticipating the upcoming masterclass features.  Overall, I would highly recommend this app for guided meditations and mindfulness practice.  Great work Calm!!"
571,2017-09-03 21:02:13,5,"Tried the free 7 days, then paid for a year subscription. The woman who narrates the teachings has a lovely speaking voice - a big reason why I chose to pay for this app. The visuals, changeable backgrounds, and sounds are beautiful. There are sets of teachings for calming anxiety, focus, more. Also, there is a new meditation for each day, and even stories to help you go to sleep. Although I have Insight Timer, an awesome meditation app that is free, I still paid for a year of this one (cheaper to pay for a year than month by month) and most days just use Calm. Been using the app for several months. It's wonderful."
572,2020-10-28 16:37:05,5,"I have migraines that are caused by (or made worse by) snippets of songs getting stuck in my head on repeat. I have tried listening to music in the past, but if I know the songs, those cause the problem to get worse. I tried Calm on a whim for their sleep stories (which I love), but found their music to be really therapeutic at helping my migraines! Since the music is random and not really “songs” it can somehow reprogram my brain to get the song loops the hell out of there. I know this is a weird case, but I am so happy this helps and I became a subscriber."
573,2020-07-15 15:09:43,5,"Following the enthusiastic recommendation of a friend, I bought your app. It’s marvelous! My favorite stories are the train rides or walks in nature. Love the voices of May Charters, Ramon Tickarum, Eric Braa, and Anna Acton. Some of the classic stories, like Treasure Island and Alice in Wonderland are really done well.  This replaced all other meditation or sleep apps.  Over the past week or two, I’ve had to restart the stories up to 4 or 5 times, due to crashing. I’ve not had this problem with other apps, so I don’t think it’s my iPad.  Can you look into this please! My updates are all current."
574,2020-04-27 18:52:46,5,"I suffer with anxiety, depression, and intrusive thoughts, I’ve been practicing meditation for a couple of weeks now and I have felt so much better. I used to sleep stories to help me sleep but I realized I kept waking up every time it ended, I realized that I can’t just use it for a better sleep, so I then listened to one of the sleep practices by Dr Steve Orma, and I followed through, I meditate now in the morning and before sleeping. I recommend this app for anyone who goes through a lot and start learning how to use and grow your mind wisely and calmly. I love this app I don’t think I can go without it now."
575,2020-05-20 19:11:29,4,"After the latest update, I can no longer just go straight to my profile. When I tap “profile” it shows my nature scene. I have to tap it again to see my profile. When I tap “calendar”, it goes back to the nature scene and I have to tap it yet again to see the calendar. This is NOT calming. It is annoying. If I tap on something, I want to see that something, not the same scene that I can get just by opening the app. Now my husband, who has a low tolerance for nonsense, is making noises about canceling our subscription and moving to a different meditation app. Congratulations."
576,2019-10-30 15:27:13,5,"I can’t say enough about this app.  I was in a very low place early this year.  No confidence, sad, no motivation.  I found this app and the small lectures.  I listened to every lecture and then also started meditating.  I learned so much about living a healthy and happy life from this app.  Through it, successfully ended and got out of a damaging relationship, I started rock climbing, eating healthy, and working out.  I’m now (what I think) the best and happiest version of myself.  And it all started from this app.  Download it!  Listen to the lectures.  Attempt to meditate (I’m still attempting a year later!)."
577,2020-01-31 03:36:25,1,"I have always had a lot of trouble sleeping and a lot of stress problems. I downloaded this app mainly to be able to listen to soundscapes and music and learn to meditate, only to find that the meditation sessions and music and stories almost all require a subscription. I understand that you need to make money, but seriously! I’m still a minor with not enough money to spend on a 70 dollar subscription to an app! Not to mention that people who actually might need   something like this for a mental illness. If you’re going to create an app to help people, you should try to help everyone, not just the people who can afford it.

(You could charge less, or ask for donations and not charge at all, or you could make a free account less limited!)

I would give this 0 stars if I could"
578,2019-08-09 03:22:00,3,"I really liked the app and got tired of the limited choices. I used the free week and quit. It still told me I could have a free week so I tried to to it again but accidentally bought a year. After a couple weeks (or months) of this the app took a couple times to load. I didn't think anything of it, then I would try to load it and it took more times to fully open it. After a while, no matter how many times I tried it didn’t open. Lucky it opened on my iPad, but I think it’s annoying that it doesn’t load on my phone. I’m trying to delete and re-download to see if that fixes the problem.

UPDATE: If anyone else has the same problem what I did worked😊"
579,2018-12-19 09:55:25,1,"I’ve been hearing about this app for MONTHS through ads. I struggle with sleeping at night and also anxiety and depression. So finally, i decided to download the app and I can only listen to ONE story???? And the man had a creepy voice. How am i supposed to play around with the app and see if it’s right for me when everything is locked and it’s basically FORCING you to spend an enormous amount of money. Yeah i could use the 7 day free trial, but I’ve had bad luck with apps charging me as soon as i accept the free trial. 

 I’ve never done a review but this made me mad enough to write one because I’ve been so curious about the app and was so excited when i downloaded it only to be disappointed. I’m sorry but $70 for an app is ridiculous. I can’t believe people actually pay that much. Thanks for nothing!!"
580,2018-12-17 12:43:20,5,"This app would be perfect, if only all the narrators had lower pitched, soothing voices. Tamara, in particular seems to have the capability to lower her voice, but for some reason, she reads with a higher pitch. Not soothing or relaxing!!!! Not trying to be mean, but I’m trying to either relax or sleep. So, I avoid all sessions with her voice for that reason. Please find narrators who can use lower pitches and who have soothing voices.
Aside from that, some of the voices are very soothing, and I listen to them regularly.  The train stories are some of my favorites (Nordland, Orient Express, and Trans Siberian). Love the train sounds in the background."
581,2018-04-24 00:35:42,5,This app has been a lifesaver for me over the past month as I am going through hormonal imbalance which has caused a great deal of anxiety and some depression.  I have a dedicated time each day to use the app and work through the different meditations (so many choices!) I have also used this app in what I call my “emergency situations” where I can feel the anxiety setting in and then I know it’s time to break out Calm and my headphones and breathe right through the anxiety and anxious thoughts to calm my self down. This is a great introduction for anyone interested in starting meditation and I highly recommend it!
582,2017-12-07 19:37:24,5,"Hands down the best sleeping aid I’ve ever used! I do not Fall a sleep without listening to a sleep story or a meditation. This app helps quickly bring you to sleep even after the hectic chaos of my day. I use to sit in bed ready and scrolling social media for an hour, wasting so much valuable sleep time. Now I just turn on a sleep story and am asleep before it needs! Worth the $60 annual purchased, for the cost of a pair of shoes a year, I’m able to sleep 8 hours a night without waking. Also, their customer service is great. I had a billing issue and they went above and beyond to assist."
583,2020-10-02 14:54:48,5,"I like that there are personal stats like the number of minutes/hours of meditation completed and the longest streak of days in a row.  I have listened to the Calm app for 682 days in a row. My goal is five years in a row. I often listen to the music or the crackling fire or a purring cat. I have the daily new 10 minute meditation for dessert every day after lunch. I will often go to my saved favorites and listen to them again. I also enjoy the 10 minute spark interviews with guests. The interviews are varied and interesting. 
I never regret time spent with Calm. It’s an investment in myself and I am worth it!!"
584,2019-03-06 04:54:58,5,"I find Calm to be a extremely awesome program that has so many different choices for a diverse group of people. It has helped me so much in my sleep problems after a massive stroke  suffered a year and half ago. I strongly recommend this to anyone e.g., kids and others who likes sweet, gentle stories, music that is softhearted and can assist anyone wanting to be more grounded. It has a plethora of choices from adult to kid stories including “the little mermaid” and even a wonderful
Story told by Matthew McConaughey. I am so excited about using the Calm app and hope others feel the same way. Thank you for your APP."
585,2020-03-30 02:35:27,3,"I know this is a long review, but I think it will be worth it!! The app itself is free, but almost all of the stuff is not. You have to pay for a premium thing that will unlock the other stuff. Meditation is partly free but I don’t use that part so it’s not helpful to me. I think I would even say that the only free stuff is the background noise, which I quite like, and the breathing exercises. I know a lot of people are saying it’s worth it, but frankly, some people just can’t afford it. I believe it is a great app that really could help, that why I gave it at least 3 stars, but the not-free part is not working for me😬 so sorry! I think it could be great if some more stuff was free!! If you take this advise, best of luck!!!!👍🤗 🍀☘️"
586,2019-05-29 01:08:02,4,"This app is so great. Not only does it offer all the meditative options, but also sleep stories! The stories are great to help me drift off to sleep because they give me something to think about other than worrisome things. I like the nonfiction ones-I learn a few new things! Even in the middle of the night, the sleep stories help me fall back asleep. I’m giving the app only 4/5 stars because there should be an option to play multiple stories back to back without waking up to turn on another one, like a sleep stories playlist. It’s the only flaw I’ve found. Add that option, developers, and I’m giving the app five stars."
587,2018-11-26 14:02:52,5,"I’ve struggled with sleep since high school—I’ve always had racing thoughts and anxiety as I try to fall asleep. It can take hours, and when I wake up in the middle of the night, falling back asleep feels impossible. Calm totally changed that. I put on a sleep story and I’m out like a light; these days, I’m asleep within 5-10 minutes max. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I pop a story on and I fall right back asleep. I’ve also used the download feature to help with falling asleep when traveling internationally, which is a flying and jet lag game-changer. Can’t recommend enough."
588,2017-12-11 03:10:07,5,"I have been using calm for YEARS (since 2014). And with the free subscription of it for the simple body scans (which I have relied on since I started using the app to sleep). And for some reason, they decided to make all of the guided meditations (including the previous free ones) exclusive to the paid subscription. I am a broke college student with chronic depression and I have sleeping issues, I’ve relied on that simple body scan for years and I haven’t been sleeping well without it but I can’t afford to pay for the subscription. So, I say to the creators of calm, thanks a lot guys I’m very disappointed."
589,2020-11-14 11:38:58,5,"Most mornings I wake up and reach for my phone to scan the latest news. Headlines are often filled with conflict and tension. It helps me to remember to meditate. Calm is an incredible resource full of relaxing guided meditations which help me focus on timeless truths, rather than a world of troubles. At night when I lie in bed mulling a myriad of responsibilities, an endless list of to dos, lamenting the past, fearing an uncertain future, it helps when I pause to breath and listen to one of the many soothing and delightful sleep stories available on Calm. I am grateful to have found this truly wonderful and powerful tool."
590,2020-12-01 19:23:44,2,"If you can afford the $70 a year for Calm Premium, by all means enjoy. That’s their only price point beyond the now-bare-bones free service. They constantly change the app and remove your favorite features with reckless abandon. In a world of constant pressure and chaotic change, the one thing I would expect from an app whose name is LITERALLY CALM, is some continuity. And I suppose they’ve shown that to an extent— they continually remove useful features either permanently or place them behind a pay wall. If they had different price points or different payment plans, then I would believe they’re actually invested in one’s mental health. Instead they’ve repeatedly shown that they’re only interested in the health of their bank accounts."
591,2020-09-25 08:12:22,5,"So I usually don’t write reviews. Like at all, but I really believe in this app and use it on a daily basis whenever I’m having trouble sleeping, studying, or just need some background noise. 

I’ve used this product for over a year and it’s completely worth every penny. They have a plethora of options, from stories, to popular people guest speaking. They have kid stories as well. And it’s really all about being “Calm” and relaxing. 

Which in a time like this relaxing and finding our peaceful place is what we need. Support this app it deserves it."
592,2020-10-12 06:28:41,4,"I really love the app, the design is perfect  and everything is nicely organized. Also the  content is very useful, you can find all kinds of meditation sessions. However now it seems too expensive, so I'm canceling my subscription. I would like to propose to have a bigger range of subscribtions with different prices where some people can get only what they use or have limited time usage, for example I use only the meditations and no additional things like sleep stories etc. I hope that we could receive some cheaper options as currently even if the app is the best many people will look for alternatives."
593,2020-01-03 05:30:35,5,"I’m a student and this really helps me, I did it in my classroom once! I wanted to get the app so I could do the same at home, but soon I realized that there is only a little I can do and that COULD get unamusing afterwards..! And my parents would never allow me to get premium and pay about $70 at the end of the year. What would happened if people needed this app but wasn’t allowed to buy premium. Do you really care about others or are you just doing it for the money!?!?

Basically all I’m asking is for you to make more stuff available for people who don’t have premium"
594,2019-09-15 23:32:28,5,"I have a major sleep disorder which is so bad, I am currently on disability. This app has totally turned me around! It not only offers up meditation and breathing sessions which I can use, but most importantly, there are id 
Abedtime stories! Offering a wide variety of topics, voices range from beautiful feminine pitches to comforting male tones. You can choose whispering voices as well. It is so nice to have my own vocal channels to choose from, whatever I need. New stories are added up occasionally to add to the mix. So...I highly recommend this app for anyone who needs help sleeping or just plain relaxing."
595,2019-08-06 04:44:04,5,"After losing both my parents early and going forward through my life like a bullet, my late 30’s hit and I suffer from relentless night time depression and loneliness. I am not physically lonely I have a family so couldn’t figure out where this came from but it’s here. Paying drs, acupuncture, therapy etc no one can help alleviate what I am suffering....until this app. It feels like my mom is here and whispering to my everything is going to be alright. The bedtime stories help me drift off to sleep! No need for meds or expensive copays this app literally saved my life! Please don’t ever take it away ❤️"
596,2019-08-16 20:31:48,1,"Well just like anything else in this world you have to pay to ease your depression when for some people money could be the issue in why they are depressed in the first place. My issue is when I first started using this app there were multiple things that were feee especially the calming music that really helped me, re downloaded the app and everything had a lock on it. Your only option is free trial. I really dislike when a lot of people start liking a app & then they decide to charge for everything, thought this app was pretty cool to have free things and really help people out but really all they are after is money. Use to be a great app for me I’ve recently found another app that’s exactly the same pretty much except their healing doesn’t have a price on it."
597,2021-02-22 02:08:23,5,"Let me start by saying that; there isn’t an app out there that can do what good counselors and therapists do. Devolving mindful techniques is helpful in learning about yourself and how to deal with unexpected emotions, but being able to talk to someone and have them actively listen is a necessity at some point in everyone’s lives. 

I love this app! Everything from the bedtime stories to the masterclasses and the spark stories; it has helped me function in this every changing world by giving me the permission to stop and breathe. I always recommend it to people who are stressed or have trouble sleeping."
598,2019-06-18 15:17:35,4,"I really love this app it truly works with my inner self. Every session makes me want another session and there are so many to choose from. However, I did rate the app 4stars because I wish it allows you to make small monthly payments instead of 1 yearly payment. I won’t be keeping the app after my trial because of the large expected payment. If you have the funds right now I recommend using and keeping the app after your trial. If not I recommend you waiting until you can afford the $70 to start your trial because it is an awesome app and you will want to buy it. Don’t tease yourself like I have because the app is amazing."
599,2021-01-16 11:02:23,5,I have had the calm app for a few years. Lately the quality of the new sleep stories has been terrific. I recommend trying the app. I love the new Red Rock Country story. I find the sleep stories have regulated my sleep after years of so-so sleeping. I am working on my meditation and so far the calm app has helped although I am struggling to find a meditation program that I can use long term. As a beginner in this area what Calm offers is helpful to build a consistent practice. Overall I am pleased with the content and I hope Calm continues to provide even better content.
600,2021-01-15 14:19:51,5,"What I love most about Calm, is it is only 10 minutes a day, if you choose, or you can select up an hour meditation. It is guided and you choose the way you meditate, whether lying down, in a nice bubble bath, or sitting in a comfortable spot. Doesn’t matter how you do it, just as long as you find 10 minutes a day. There are a variety of sleep stories and now the new Daily Trips 10 minute meditation is great because it gives guidance on daily mind situations we encounter and how to be mindful of those moments. Definitely will be a customer for life with Calm."
601,2020-11-28 19:08:25,5,"I think most people would describe me as a very cost conscious individual, my kids would say tightwad. I promise you this app, if used to it’s fullest, will be worth it’s weight in gold to you. There are so many people suffering with stress related or stress induced illnesses and this app is just overflowing with the right kind of help. I have severe RA (genetics + workaholic + southern girl people pleaser) & this app has helped me through some pretty bad flares. It has helped with my insomnia, and the educational series has helped bring about a huge shift in my professional life as well. It’s money well spent."
602,2020-07-31 15:21:31,5,"After drinking way too much coffee all day, my body was tired but my mind was alive. I tossed and turned for hours. When I noticed the sun rising and the birds beginning to chirp, I had reached full desperation. I recalled a friend raving about Harry Styles’ stories on Calm, so I downloaded it and chose the first free sleep story. Fully expecting to still be awake after the story was done, the next thing I knew I was waking up to the sound of an alarm! It works! I should have used this hours before I reached full desperation, and I’ll probably pay for the premium version."
603,2020-10-25 17:31:47,3,"Well overall I think this app is very nice,simple,calming,and helpful! 
But there is a couple of suggestions that I would love to give you! 

1.You should let us comment on the sessions and let us rate them! I think it would be helpful to know if that session is right for you
and you can also communicate with other people.

2.Lower down the price’s please? It is very expensive and for someone like me who can barely afford my rent and then when I try to mediate because of my depression, self harm, and my anxiety.. please at least lower them down? I need help with my mental health and I cannot afford this! :(

3. Unlock some sessions? Well when I first downloaded this app I realized that almost EVERYTHING is locked! And I really can’t spend my money! This is very upsetting for me and others.. think about it? other people may be having it the same as me and really need help and this is their only choice.. and when they can’t get the mediation, results love, relief they need they maybe going down a very dangerous road!.. please.

Thank you for reading and god bless you! 💞💞"
604,2020-09-19 20:02:42,4,Hello but just wanted to say that there was a bug in this app every time I open it it just keeps crashing and crashing and crashing and crashing and I’ve deleted this app a few months ago and that seemed to fix the problem for a little bit then it would just crash for a little bit and then it started having the same problems that it did before I deleted the app a few months ago and I always have to restart my device sometimes the app still crashes then it opens but this app always crashes a lot but other than that I’ll love this app
605,2020-09-15 08:46:22,1,"I wanted to get this app because I thought that it would be good for someone struggling with sleep such as myself. It looks good on paper, but when you finally get the darn app. 
Literally. Everything. Is. Locked. All for 70$ a year wow! Such little payment. Here’s the thing developers, most of these reviews sound stellar and most actually seem happy with this! However for some people who really need this stuff when they are struggling the most, we might not have that 70 dollars. Consider your demographic please. I see many famous people have a part in this app and I know you have to pay them somehow, but try to consider finding another way to pay them out without screwing us all over. 

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk XD"
606,2020-04-14 07:50:45,5,"I have always had trouble falling asleep. I am not the type of person who can just lay in bed and fall asleep within 5 minutes. I am the type that will lay in bed, read my emails, check my finance apps, check social media, browse netflix, browse something else and then do it all over again until I get sleepy and finally fall asleep after 2 hours of laying in bed. BUT...since I subscribed to calm, I put on my headphones and listen to a session of sleep (which are usually 8-20 mins) and I am asleep before the session even ends! I love it!!"
607,2019-12-31 06:03:58,5,"I’ve tried different meditation techniques over the years and have had moderate success. This one stands out as the best and even after only a few sessions I have found a great deal of peace. I love the simplicity of this approach. It makes sense to me. It has been so helpful to calm my mind. As a parent of teens and a high school teacher, life has brought me to my knees. This app is helping me cope with the madness that is my life. I eagerly look forward to the sessions. Anxiety is a constant in my everyday experience, but I have a lot of help in managing it with these techniques. It is worth every cent."
608,2019-12-05 02:14:10,5,"I enjoy the app , it’s amazing definitely help with my anxiety, and meditation. I have referred this app to my husband and friends . However , while using the app on my phone (iPhone XR) , it works perfectly while my screen is lite, and hasn’t locked. But once my phone screen goes off ( kinda goes to sleep/lock screen) the calm app shuts off and I have to stop relaxing unlock my phone and then the app resume playing . It’s distracting and a downside . Maybe I don’t know how to adjust this or what but could someone check into this and fix it or tell me how ????? Thanks !"
609,2019-12-28 20:30:42,1,"Being forced to sign in with Facebook or provide your email is unnecessary. It's just a means to be able to bombard you with spam. I won't do it, I get way too many BS emails & ads already.
  The ONE MINUTE ads from this app are a bit ridiculous also. No one likes ads in the middle of games and other apps but we're forced to put up with them.  99.9% of them are 15-30 seconds or less tho, so they're bearable. Not the ads for this app, they're a full minute of unwanted interruption.
  This app provides something that Im interested in, something I want and actually need. Too bad they have to be so Extra tho, demanding to get into your Fb and/or email, as well as the terrible full minute ads. These 2 things have made me decide to pass on an app that I could really use:("
610,2019-11-30 18:00:44,5,"This app is amazing. I’ve had it for about six months and it calms me so much. I love the stories so much that the tone makes me go right to sleep. I don’t even finish it 80% of the time!! The narrators do great and talk in this soft tone that soothes your anxiety even more. The meditations make you concentrate on your body and let every bad thought slip away. There are no adds (i think) but it does glitch some. So plz fix that. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who struggles to sleep or has hard work days or lots of homework, etc. TRUST ME you will not regret your choice."
611,2019-10-07 14:32:05,5,"Calm is wonderful because it focuses on helping you create a new relationship to yourself and to your emotions. It emphasizes recognizing your experience without placing judgment on it, offering me, a self-critical person, a wonderful opportunity to practice self-care. It is particularly good for anyone dealing with an anxiety disorder (although of course talk with your therapist to make sure it fits right for your particular needs) because rather than focus on helping you eliminate anxiety (a thought process that never works) it focuses on helping you create a new relationship to anxiety (which somehow works!). I love this app"
612,2019-05-04 00:28:29,5,"This is a wonderful app. I have PTSD, major depressive disorder, and panic disorder. This is the first app that has actually calmed me down and uses some of the same coping and meditation skills that I have learn at some the the top trauma hospitals in the USA. The only bone I have to pick is that the 40% discount coupon they sent me in my email won’t let me use it. It just send me to the calm app not the place where you pay. It does not however do this on my mom phone so it could just be my phone. I don’t know but I highly recommend this app to anyone who suffers from trauma or anxiety."
613,2019-04-23 11:43:44,5,"In the past year, I have had to deal with many serious, stressful, and sad situations. I never knew from day to day what would come my way. The one thing I knew I could count on, was my CALM app. I began each morning with meditation and the Daily Calm. It brought instant peace and confidence. During the day, if things became overwhelming, I would listen to one of the many excellent meditations on anxiety or stress. My walks would include listening to the excellent Master classes. I have listened Daily now for over a year, and it has had a huge impact on my life. To Tamara and everyone at CALM, thank you!"
614,2019-03-20 00:52:02,5,"I signed up for Calm about 4 months ago with a free trial positive that I would cancel at the end.  2 nights into using it I knew this app was worth every cent!

Calm has helped me (as someone working in the social work field) fall asleep when my mind is racing.  When my kids are having a hard time calming down we use it to stop and breathe.  I have used this app nearly every day since I downloaded it and have been so impressed by the new content being added (helloooooo Matthew McConaughey)! 

The kids beg for a sleep story every night and I cherish the cuddles while we listen ♥️"
615,2019-01-18 02:43:05,5,"Calm is a perfect way to relax, morning, afternoon, or night. With amazing stories, music, meditations, this amazing app will sure cure the beating migraines we all get. One really cool thing about Calm is that it keeps track of everything, for example, it would tell you how many days in a row you used Calm or how many hours in total you listen to stories, music, or meditation. You can even download so if you are on the go and don’t have WiFi, no worries, Calm has your back. They only gave me 5 stars to fill out, but if there were more, I would fill them all out. Out of 5 stars, I rate Calm 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999/ 5"
616,2018-11-06 02:30:33,5,"I love calm so much I can’t even describe it. I went out on my friend’s deck, faced towards the ocean, and I was more relaxed than ever it really helps with my anxiety and everything, no other app even comes close to comparing to this. There is so much you can do, and it gives me a second to stop what I’m doing on my phone, and take a breath. It ends up being so much fun!!! I thought meditation was boring, until I tried this. The voices are so calming, and they have sleep stories, and songs, and so many different meditation choices. I rarely ever write reviews, but I immediately loved this app! Thanks Calm!"
617,2018-09-11 14:51:27,5,"I have never been one to buy into things like meditation as I just didn’t know anyone using it and therefore, didn’t think it would have much of an affect.  After 32 consecutive days of meditating, I am literally shocked at the difference in clarity and focus I’m experiencing.  I am getting much more accomplished every day and I’m able to relax more and feel less overwhelmed by life as I’m living it much more in the moment.  I’ve been searching for solutions to “life’s puzzle” as far back as I can remember and I think I may have finally found the answer.  This is exciting!"
618,2018-02-03 19:58:37,5,"I have been using this app for two years now and love it. I look forward to doing my daily meditation and love that I can add anxiety and body scans when needed. I have spinal stenosis and on the bad days I do a longer body scan and it helps so much. 

The only problem I have with this app is that when I use on my iPhone it will shut down on start up and it takes three tries to open and get started. I downloaded the latest update and it did not fix the problem. I also cannot get the scenes to open on a horizontal screen. It works perfectly on my iPad."
619,2021-01-18 14:07:47,3,"Unfortunately, the main voice on the app is like nails on a chalkboard to me, not soothing at all. So, the daily sessions she offers and many of the specialty sessions, I can’t listen to. I realize we are all different, but I wish there were more voice options for situations like this, or that she would hire a voice actor with a soothing tone like all of her guests. At this point, I can only enjoy guest sessions so I will be discontinuing my subscription and switching to another similar app that I’ve found. 
I do like this app and find that it helps my child and myself. Let me know if the voice options come about, and I’ll subscribe again. There are some nice exercises and affirmations here."
620,2020-07-06 02:10:01,5,"I would use the Calm app from time to time before I had the full access. I always liked it but didn’t want to spend money on another yearly subscription. Thanks to my Amex card, I was recently able to get a 1 year subscription, courtesy of my credit card company. Probably the best perk of the card so far. Now, I use this app multiple times a week. Sometimes to meditate and 4-5 times a week I use it to help me fall asleep. The nature sound, the stories and the meditation guides are all incredible. I really get so much from this app."
621,2020-11-28 13:14:50,4,"I am iPhone user 13.7 Ver, and two year subscriber to Calm.  
But What has happened at Calm?  Update this week has changed the format and I can’t locate anything. Menu titles along the top of the screen are useless.  For instance, in the meditate section, titles look like this:  SI...  An...  Begi...  St...  ...  Self-...
Really?   And now the advertising blitz for reduced price sales?  New owners?
This app has been invaluable to me, helping me sleep, keeping me calm during anxiety triggers, and meditation series was instrumental in helping me through pain management after total hip replacement in July. Please fix this new format. It isn’t working."
622,2020-04-15 11:03:41,5,I like how it gives you an option to have unlocked items even if you don’t have subscription but I think it would be better if more then one thing per section was unlocked. I am not saying take the subscription away just I have found only one sleepcast that is unlocked and when you are testing it out without the seven day trial you need to be able to listen to more than “moshi and the slumber tree”. Other than that very good app for restless people and when you need to just relax. Also I like how there is options for kids.
623,2020-05-27 17:37:58,1,"Calm tries very hard to cater to the emotional expectations of someone who doesn't yet understand what mindfulness is. It has ambient nature sounds, lots of voices trying really hard to be soothing, and an impressive hodgepodge of options. Unfortunately it doesn't really seem to teach much. A lot of time is spent on abstract personal anecdotes, celebrity humble brags, and portraying as many different ideas of mindfulness as possible. The very first ""How to Meditate"" session makes you listen to the teacher's life story and ideas for 3 minutes before actually explaining anything. There's no real structure or sense of progress, so there's not much to commit to. If you want to relax for 20 minutes, Calm may help. If you want to learn and deepen a practice that applies beyond those 20 minutes, look elsewhere."
624,2020-01-25 12:11:48,5,"I’ve had the calm app, with the subscription for over a year.  I use the meditations and have found that I’m getting better at doing them.  I have also found that I really do feel better during my day.  I also really like the sleep stories and use them frequently, especially when I travel to help me settle into a good night sleep.  If you are thinking about getting the app, it is worth trying.  I have never been sorry that I have it and even if I go through periods where I use it less, knowing it’s there when I need it, is helpful."
625,2020-02-24 08:27:53,3,I’ve been using calm for over a year now. Downloaded the app when everything was free and now since it’s grown in popularity mostly all sounds and stories that were once free are now all locked even just a couple days ago there was one water sound that was still unlocked and now it’s locked. I’ve been with them for a long time and shouldn’t be forced to pay I feel and if on my account you see things were unlocked and saved why go and lock them to try to make me pay. That doesn’t make me want to pay for premium it makes me want to not use this once great app anymore because they no longer have things for free. I’m saddened honestly.
626,2020-01-09 17:45:09,5,"I’ve used Calm for several years. However over the past year I have begun a serious daily practice of meditation in my life. Calm makes it easy to meditate with it’s 10-13 minute guided meditations via educational series on many topics including gratitude, happiness, forgiveness, sleep, etc. I have found that each mediation provides me with a lesson that extends into my day and life. I absolutely love Calm and as a therapist I recommend it to all my patients, friends, and family. Mediation is something I feel that I look forward and enjoy now. I have replaced some unhealthy coping habits with mediation and I will be forever grateful! 

Thank you Calm! Some of my favorite meditation guides on Calm are Tamara Levitt, Jeff Warren (is love to see more stuff from him in the future), and Tara Bach.  Thank you all! I feel connected and comforted by your voices of wisdom and guidance. 

I encourage EVERYONE to commit to a daily practice 30 days! Your life will never be the same. 

With Gratitude,
Jessica"
627,2019-12-12 15:03:20,5,"I’ve used Calm since the first year they came out.  I could not be without this app.  I use several times each day.  I wake up to meditate to awesome guidance, I listen to soothing music when I’m stressed, I go to sleep listening to wonderful sleep stories.
    It’s been like going to Disneyland when I discover new things they’ve added.  It gets better and better!
Note to Calm:  Please keep your original people at the same rate, because I know it’s going to go up.
Can’t say enough, I even played Cam music for my daughter when she was in labor.
Calm:  Thank you!!"
628,2019-10-09 11:42:11,5,"I love this app! It has so many options and types of meditations. Depending on how I feel or the amount of time I have at the moment I can choose my meditation time. Although many of the guided meditations or 10 min which I can always make time for and they are so effective. 

I listen to the classes while I am cleaning. 

I suffer from insomnia so what I use the most are the bedtime stories and go back to sleep meditations. I love them. They are very effective at keeping my mind at bay and soothing me back to sleep.

I love that I can download anything on the app to listen to offline while I am in a flight and traveling.

When I use this app consistently and meditate everyday I feel a huge shift in my mental state and overall wellbeing. In this app you can also easily track which days you have been using it.

Next to IG this is my most used app and also money spent wisely.
Thank you Calm app for making it so much easier to meditate and be consistent."
629,2019-08-14 17:55:29,5,"UPDATED:  previously I had rated this app with one star (and prematurely posted a negative comment) because when I got a new phone I thought the new version had taken away all of the scenes that I had.( I had the free version) However, it turned out to be operator error as I didn’t realize I had to go back into the app to re-download the scenes again as customer service informed me.

My review of app: I have the free version and I really love the scenes and the music. I’ve used it many times to help me get to sleep or to just simply relax and meditate.
Great app!"
630,2019-09-01 02:23:48,4,"First of all I adore this app and use it every night.  This is the first time in my life I have been able to sleep without medication which is very impressive.

I do most of the sleep stories every night and they are very effective but some nights I could definitely use a longer story. Also a lot of the stories jump straight in where as I could use a brief meditation to get myself physically comfortable. “Close your eyes and settle in” isn’t quite long enough for me. One of the options I see would be to stack the stories with a guided meditation preprogrammed to follow with a sleep story."
631,2019-06-07 00:35:14,5,I have experienced panic attacks for 10 years. I will admit I balked at the price but it is well worth it. There are several excellent meditations for when you have a panic attack. I like that they range from a 3 minute emergency calm to a 30 minute session. I have worked through several of the meditation series & each one is excellent—a great combination of guided breathing with education. The master classes I have done were very informative. I definitely feel listening to a meditation daily has helped me reduce my overall level of anxiety. Outstanding App
632,2019-05-29 17:23:15,5,"This app has really helped me with my depression and anxiety. I’m finally at a point where I can recognize when my emotions are heightened (good or bad) and Calm really helps me to center and focus my feelings. I am a high school dance teacher and my students love this app! They ask to mediate all the time, especially before exams. I recommended it to all of them. It also helps my husband. He is in high stress situations and sometimes can’t sleep at night. When I feel him tossing and turning I know to put the app on. Within about 10-15 minutes he is calm and falling asleep. I am thankful for this app!"
633,2018-08-23 22:31:33,5,"I got the trial version and when due without asking or telling me I was billed us$60 for a full the most expensive 1 year subscription. There is nowhere to complain or to ask cancellation, including the App store. Once you agree to get charged you are in for life, no way out. I write this after 1 month if being forced to be subscribed to this scam. Have receive several emails apologizing but still have no refund on an App I did not wanted and was deducted by Apple without alerting me. Make yourself a favor avid this app which locks you forever with them"
634,2019-02-22 23:09:47,4,"I love Calm! Have been using for years. The iPhone app works great. But the Apple Watch app seems basically useless. When you try to start a daily calm for that day, after you select start it just keeps spinning. I’ve had two iPhones and two watches I’ve tried this on with the same result. And even if it worked, it doesn’t look like you can select any of the sleep stories or music. Just play the daily calm and that’s it. Would be nice to have full access to play the other functions especially lying in bed at night I could easily change on my phone. Guess I gotta get the app working first."
635,2019-02-10 00:54:43,3,"I’m gonna start off by saying this is a really great app. And don’t get me wrong absolutely love it. But it does have some issues. 
        I love this app a lot. And yeah, I will admit, I don’t use this app as much as I would like to because of how expensive the premium version is. Only a couple are free but the rest you have to pay for it on Premium. But the Premium isn’t just $20. We’re talking like at least $70 per year. I know it isn’t that much but still, $70? And I know that’s ho should make money, I get that. If it wasn’t so expensive I would definitely pay for the Premium because I wanna be able to use this app way more than I do now. I get stressed out a lot and always have difficulty sleeping at night and am not able to go to sleep right away (even when I’m exhausted) like everyone else in my family. 
     Note to Editor: 
Please try to lower the price. I would really love this app if it wasn’t as expensive. Otherwise you have done a really great job with this app. It’s great 
Thank you
May the relaxation be with you 🙂🧘‍♀️🙂🧘‍♂️👍🏼"
636,2017-11-12 23:10:03,5,I have an autistic son who has a hard time settling his emotions. I showed him this app and now when he is having a meltdown he asks to use the app to help sooth him. The sleep stories have helped him calm in the evening before bed as well as the calming visuals and sounds. He likes to follow the breath circle as well. Because he is a visual person he really responds to the visual representation for the breath. He is only 6 years old and has learned some valuable mindfulness tools from this app. I recommend it to everyone. Thank you for developing this app it truest has been a lifesaver so many times.
637,2017-12-19 20:14:13,1,"I love this app, I really do. But I have experienced on more than one occasion this app causing my iPhone to crash and reset, which gets annoying when you are working on something or trying to watch a class online or in the middle of something. 

I have deleted all apps and added them one at a time to see which app was the culprit and isolated the cause to this app. I don’t know what it is about this one that is causing the issue, but I know that this app is causing my iPhone to crash and restart unexpectedly. 

I hope this issue gets fixed soon, because it really is awesome when working correctly, and since it has been rated as a 2017 App of the Year, I expect it to work bug-free. Until that issue gets fixed, though, this app is a fail."
638,2021-02-13 12:56:47,5,"Update:   Your newest update repaired the glitch caused by the previous update. No more crashes. Thank you!  I mostly use Calm for the background sounds and sleep stories however I have enjoyed several other features like The Spark.  I would suggest that the Daily Calm be narrated by other voices in case the main narrator’s voice doesn’t work for your listeners. A little variety is nice.  Overall a good app. 

Old: I enjoyed Calm until the latest update. Now I get a purple “take a deep breath” screen and then it crashes and closes. No access possible.  FIX THIS PLEASE!"
639,2021-02-08 11:40:04,5,"Whenever the manic pace and daily stress of life pushes my brain into overdrive, careening from all that did not get done today and bouncing off all that must be done tomorrow, the soothing music and simplistic sounds of nature embrace the soul ever so gently.  Somehow my mind  is transported to simpler times and back to a place of Calm.  As stress is gradually replaced with a sense of well-being, my entire spirit is regenerated and healed.  What a wonderful gateway to peace.  In this state of being fully present,  I am once again centered on all that is truly important in this journey of life!   All else falls away... Thanks Calm!  I needed that..."
640,2021-02-04 03:11:58,5,"It would literally take me hours to fall asleep because my mind would just wonder, but the sleep stories and soundscapes have put my mind wondering to an end. They’re interesting enough to keep your mind focused, yet soothing enough to let you fall asleep (not like having the tv on while trying to sleep). I use this app every night when falling asleep and sometimes turn it back on if I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. I highly highly highly recommend the Calm app and everything it has to offer."
641,2020-05-25 02:55:00,5,"This app will literally make you feel like you are younger! I couldn’t sleep for nearly 2 nights in a row, by the third night I felt almost insane.  I found this app, downloaded it.  Literally a miracle, I did a meditation therapy and then put thunderstorm on, I was asleep within minutes after the thunderstorm music started playing.  I even had a dream I could remember, which has been a year since my last. I will use this app until my final slumber, and hopefully the app will be on so I can die peacefully in my dreams!"
642,2020-06-30 04:52:22,1,When you download this app it says that it is free but when you open it up there are two things that are free but they are very good but that is the only thing I can give the app Calm credit for. They just want you to spend money instead of helping you calm down. This app is so frustrating because one night I could not fall asleep so I saw commercial for Calm and downloaded it but when I open the app I could only do one thing and it wasn’t even the thing I was looking for. So if I give you one suggestion to make them improve their app would be to make more stuff free. You’ll get a lot more people to download the app and probably even more people to pay for premium. Thank you for reading this and I hope you will take into account my suggestion. Thank you
643,2020-04-05 12:20:46,5,"A friend told me about Calm. I was pretty skeptical about it, having tried sound machines and white noise machines that didn’t work. But this is different. I’ve been using it for about 2 months now and I’ve only finished one story. The voices completely calm me and lull me into a deep sleep. 
I find that there are certain narrators who have better voices than others. I’m sorry, John McEnroe reading the rules of tennis did nothing for me. But others are so beautifully calm and soothing that I barely get more than five minutes of the story. 
I will be recommending this to all my friends."
644,2019-08-30 05:50:24,5,"I am a small business owner that works with an overwhelming amount of clients each day for very long hours. I have found it extremely difficult to fall asleep at night or even nap during the day because of the inability to turn my brain off from work overload. I’ve struggled to fall asleep quickly and deeply for 10 years. This app changed all of that!

The Calm app is some sort of magical trickery, the bedtime stories are hypnotic and soothing and work so well that I’ve never even been able to get 1/4 of the way into one before completely Passing out. The narrators featured are so comforting in the delivery of each story. 

My 8 year old son has the same reaction to the children’s stories, he falls asleep instantly.

I’m so thankful for all the other features this app has that help with my anxiety during the day as well.

Download it and you won’t regret it! Plus, who doesn’t want to fall asleep to Matthew McConaughey whispering in your ear?"
645,2018-10-17 20:10:28,5,"I suffer from anxiety and depression and with my most recent bout I found this app. I had never meditated before but thought I would give it a try. I am almost fully recovered now and I truly believe this app had a lot to do with it!  I am actually kicking myself for not meditating sooner!  It’s a life changer!  I meditate twice a day, once with the daily calm and another with one of the series.  I also love the master class and the sleep portion!  Tamara’s voice is very soothing also.  I am definitely happy with this and if nothing changes with the app I will probably re-subscribe for life."
646,2018-07-16 16:29:17,5,"It’s no surprise that this app has the Editor’s Choice Award. It’s fantastic! I decided to try it on a whim after seeing it advertised here in the App Store and reading some reviews.

Since my early teens, I’ve always been in touch with my spirituality and turned to meditation and yoga/exercise for dealing with emotional baggage and anxiety. Lately I’ve hit some roadblocks and plateaus in my personal growth. I couldn’t be any more grateful for this app. There are so many topics/categories of meditations to choose from. And the meditation guide, Tamara Levitt, is just angelic. I sink almost as soon as I hear her voice. 

Thank you, Calm! 🙏🏼"
647,2018-01-31 04:31:49,5,"I purchased this app because of it’s high ratings and advertising that it records to Health App for mindfulness.  Initially, I had trouble getting the minutes to transfer to the Health app. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.  I wrote to the support staff and within minutes heard back with suggestions to correct the problem.  Cory was patient and continued to communicate with me several times with suggestions and explanations.  The problem was resolved.  Not only do I love the meditations and features of Calm, I can not say enough about the responsiveness and customer service!"
648,2018-02-04 14:43:14,4,"I love the way this app runs on my phone. I love that I can have the audio run in the background of other things, and that that's a *choice* rather than a default. I love that I can add in manual sessions to the tracker. I love that there is internal storage control.

The scenes and background music are wonderful and impressively varied, and the guided meditations are very easy to use and easy to follow.

However, while $60/year is not unreasonable (breaking it down to $5/month, that seems very affordable!), I would vastly prefer the ability to pay month by month, and to buy individual meditations for access without a subscription. I don't have $60 up front for this, but I could probably find $5 at a time, and I would be willing to put a couple extra dollars toward particularly helpful ones or ones I wanted to check out when I can't afford a subscription.

So overall, fantastic, and I'm recommending it to everyone I know, but I wish the pricing were more accessible."
649,2020-12-16 03:19:48,5,"I was having a horrible time falling asleep about a year ago. I did not want to fall into the sleeping pill habit, so on a whim I downloaded the calm app. The very first night I fell asleep within minutes to one of the sleep stories. Thinking it was beginners luck or wishful thinking, I gave it a full week, and I fell asleep within minutes each night. I happily purchased the yearly subscription and I listen to it every single night. I couldn’t tell you what a single sleep story is about, AND THAT’S THE POINT! I love this app and my youngest child listens to it every night as well. I LOVE THIS APP!!"
650,2020-07-04 15:23:29,5,"This app has helped me to learn to manage stress and take a much needed break from the busyness of life. It’s professional and doesn’t take much time to use. I highly recommend it to friends all the time and even have my 9 and 13 year olds use the sleep stories and guided meditations. I love that there are series that help you to go deeper into a topic and practice mindfulness at the same time. I enjoyed the guided meditations so much, I decided to purchase the full app - definitely a worthy and small investment for the peace of mind and life long stress reducing strats training this app provides."
651,2020-12-10 03:36:05,4,I’ve been using the subscription version for almost a year.  I will renew.  The sleep stories are fantastic.  The daily calm messages are helpful.  There is a lot of variety within the app.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are 2 things I would change... the white font on light gray background is hard to read.  It would be nice if we could select colors or shades or contrast.  The 2nd would be background music during sleep stories - either let the background scene noise continue to play during the story (as an option) or add an option for sleep music.
652,2019-12-20 05:10:02,5,"I have experienced panic attacks since childhood.   A couple of years ago something new started that frightened me.  I didn’t recognize it as anxiety.  Fours years of doctors, tests...no diagnosis or help.  Finally a neurologist prescribed citalopram.  Just about that time I discovered Calm.  I feel like I have my life back!  The drug helps, but if I let days go by without using Calm, I can feel the anxiety and tension returning.  It seems to “reset” my brain.  It has really trained me to be more cognizant of my anxiety and tension and now I can quickly use some of the techniques I’ve learned.  I am very grateful for it."
653,2018-06-21 08:16:55,5,I especially like the topics of self-help meditation and I am in love with master classes with these master classes I have not only learned more about food cravings subconscious eating and things like that then I think I have ever heard from anybody or read from any other book the people who have given these classes are wonderful I have even gone out and bought their books my daughter and my son have also learned to use this as meditation to keep them selves calm before bed and to use Calm with a heavy or stressful day like testing it has helped my family thank you Calm.
654,2019-11-29 14:11:58,1,"“Take a deep breath” was the last calm moment. I had to sign up for a free trial to get into the app. It wasn’t what I wanted. I can’t listen to videos when my spouse finds noise annoying. There’s a breathing animation, but I have that for free on my Apple Watch. 

When I tried to cancel the free subscription 5 minutes after downloading, it signed me up for a $84 years subscription, WHICH I CAN’T CANCEL!!!  I have spent 2 hours so far and will have many more hours, I predict, from Apple and my bank before I get the charge removed. I am furious, and very far from calm. 

Needless to say, I deleted the app. $89 a year (what’s on my credit card) for cheap videos of someone reading stories, a breathing video that I have for free elsewhere, and music. I have no idea why it received an “Editors Choice”."
655,2019-06-14 06:03:48,2,"If you love language, for the love of God stay away from the travel stories.  A more insipid collection of memoirs don’t exist. It is 2 am and I just couldn’t get through the cringe-worthy Yurt story. So I tried Morocco.  Do you people curate this stuff?  Maybe some listeners fall asleep giggling but I am grumpy at 2 am. 

Next most awful are the relaxation and sleep audio offerings that all say exactly the same thing. Get a writer.  Topping the list in this category is one sleep audio that almost put me to sleep until the narrator jumped in after a few minutes of silence and scared the bejeesus out of me.  Dude: once you go silent, shut your pie hole.  

Still, the classic stories are often read well and with grace.  Stick with these and you should be safe."
656,2018-12-14 07:15:21,2,"This app used to be great, I’m not saying once you make an app to keep it free forever but it went from pretty great with a. Few features for people willing to pay $50+ for all, to needing to buy most to use the app at all. Why not offer a $4.99 one time buy that includes a few standard background noises instead of deciding one day to lock them all and say a persons gotta buy premium now, I must say I hate to move to a different app as your user interface is great but this is just rediculous, you might as well just ask for the money up front when a user downloads the app instead of not allowing anything on a FREE app in the store, that’s a little misleading if I must say, mainly just because I remember how things used to be."
657,2017-12-10 12:37:52,5,"First of all this app is AMAZING! I always get stressed over the tiniest things like a pop quiz I didn’t study for, getting that one B on my report card, and when I have too much homework. Yeah, I get stressed a lot. I saw this game in my recommendations and I figured I tried it out. I loved it right away. I did the meditating for 7 days of relieving stress and it did help me since I don’t get as stressed as I usually do, so I tried a few others. Then after doing these meditating sessions I realized how much I changed (in a good way!☺️) and how I became a better person. I definitely recommend this app!🤗"
658,2020-10-08 10:17:00,5,Calm has made its way into my morning daily routine. It a has also told my children bedtime stories after we do an evening children’s meditation. It has helped me fall asleep when I am overwhelmed. It has even helped me rest with a nap here and there. Calm was recommended to me over a year ago... after 6 months I become a lifetime member. In just that short amount of time I could feel the wonderful impact it had on my life and my family. So grateful for all the amazing people that work to put together Calm. I recommend it to everyone!
659,2020-03-31 20:35:12,5,"Recently my P.E teacher sent me a link for calm, I decided to try it, I heard about these relaxing apps, I though this is going to be like the other ones. It says it’s good but it’s not. I tried it I started with the LeBron James, it was great, then I moved on to the how are you feeling, I was stressed and I wrote it, then it gave me a stress relieving video after I was so calm. I love calm and will recommend it to all people I know, it gives me just what I need, and really helps me. Nothing I have ever tried before for calming apps worked, but calm is different it helps all my needs, and is the best app ever!"
660,2020-03-25 04:51:15,5,"I love calm, I have used it for years. I went to use it tonight only to find out majority of the sounds were now “locked,” and I needed to purchase to listen. I never minded that some sounds were locked, however, a lot of sounds if not most are now locked. I find that extremely selfish because there are sounds on calm that have been the only solution to my panic attacks, and currently I’m wondering what I am going to do when the next one strikes. I recommended this app, I trusted this app, and I am just really shocked that this app turned into another scam."
661,2019-10-16 20:26:18,5,"I don’t write reviews often, but I use my Calm app every single day, sometimes three times a day!
I especially love the sleep stories, they really help me get my brain off my to-do list and to relax.
The app is a little pricey, but since I use it several times a day, I believe it is worth the money. 
It has helped me become centered when I felt like I was going to fall apart. The daily messages teach me a better way to go about and think of things clearly. 
Thank you to all the Calm Contributors... you make a difference in this crazy world! 💞"
662,2020-11-26 15:07:24,5,"As I went through the most traumatic experience of my life, I was introduced to Calm. 

I learned that my spouse had been lying to, deceiving, stealing from & manipulating me for years; was cheating on me, and exposing every flaw & weakness in my character, all in an effort to drive me to suicide - a PhD in Clinical Psychology, who was using every bit of his training to destroy me- successfully turning every friend, and my own family against me, and who try to take my children from me...that is when I found Calm.

Calm, quite literally, saved my life. To Tamara & all of you who invented this app; Thank You!"
663,2019-08-25 08:14:29,2,"I paid $60 for this. I used it for about a month and enjoyed it during that time but then got bored. They didn’t have enough bedtime stories. That was what I used the most. I don’t really like listening to recordings of noises. But the bedtime stories really worked well if I could find one I liked. Some of the people reading have odd voices, so I would avoid any story that they read. And there were voices that I really liked. The stories are part of the effect, but the voice was even more important to me. 
So $60 was way too much money for something that was not sustaining. If I had been able to actually use it for an entire year it definitely would have been worth it."
664,2019-08-24 04:05:00,4,"I love the app and I’m so glad that I bought the premium version. Of all the excellent narrators of sleep stories, Eric Bra is the only narrator who can put me to sleep. So please,  please provide us with more of his sleep stories. However, Tamara Levite’s voice even though nice and sensual,  is not a good voice for relaxation. It is actually very irritating. I was looking for a different voice that does the body scan, but I realized that all the guided meditations that help you sleep are done by her. Please please pick at least one sleep meditation done by another voice. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think I will renew my subscription."
665,2019-01-04 22:09:30,2,"I’ve downloaded several of these mindfulness type apps and they all follow the same format, IMO. They all kinda-sorta imply something free, but the apps are pretty much unusable in the free status. All of them are then constantly taking you to the upgrade page. Then, I’m getting email reminders about the program. They all also have the same “feel” like it’s the same 4-5 developers behind all the apps. They all try to lure you in with the free 7 day trial - and I’m sure that’s quite effective as people may forget to cancel. Also these apps are pricy imo. 

My advice to these app developers: open up the full use of the app for 10 days with no risk of payment. If people really like it they will then pay."
666,2018-09-22 22:18:10,4,"I have been using the Calm app for nine months now. Are usually find it to be fairly helpful. But given that they almost never put up new meditations I don’t think it should cost nearly as much as it does. It has good things for coping with anxiety, but nothing for coping with depression, and other mental health issues. But a wonderful device nonetheless, especially if you’re trying to get in meditation or moment of calm. This will give you five minutes or 30 minutes it’s whatever is right for you. It does glitch sometimes which I find frustrating, it will randomly turn off."
667,2018-06-07 05:44:31,1,The sheer amount of apps now that are “free” but to access them you need to pay for a subscription is ridiculous and this is just one more to add to the list. I can’t access a single thing without doing the free week trial. It’s so frustrating to find a half decent app but to not be able to afford such a large subscription rate. If it was more accessible I would absolutely purchase certain things as I had money for them but I can’t dedicate so much money to year long subscriptions. I would still keep this app if even only the daily calm was the only thing you could freely access and limiting it to once per day. If I want to keep a specific one and be able to purchase them individually that would be an app I’d be happy to keep.
668,2021-01-15 04:51:18,4,"Today is a sad day indeed. I have been a premium user of this app for over three years. Somehow my auto-renew got shut off and when I came on today, I saw that it is $70/year now? I have never paid more than maybe $20 or less for the premium service and now suddenly all of the meditations I have come to love are not accessible to me. I’m having a baby in two months and unfortunately the premium services for this app has become a frivolous expense that I can no longer justify. I’ll keep it around because I truly love this app, but it is sad to see all of my favorite sessions unavailable now. :("
669,2019-11-11 12:02:48,5,"I took an 8 week course on Mindfulness Meditation five years ago and really benefitted from it. But I drifted away from daily meditation. Since I discovered the Calm app, I have resumed daily meditation and am very happy with the program. I highly recommend trying it for free as I did, but consider subscribing as you get into it. . It is well worth the investment, and provides a large variety of themed meditations. I just started the 30 day program with Jeff for people new to or returning to meditation. It is different and inviting. I am now on the way to reestablishing my daily meditation practice."
670,2020-09-11 17:56:14,4,I am not completely satisfied with the app but it is great and I like the layout. I would definitely recommend this but not as good as other apps I have had in the past. I like listening to the calm music as I do my work at home and it has a great selection of things to listen to. I like the soundscapes the best for falling a sleep because it is the most relaxing to me but I would have liked a few more options to choose from in that category. With all said it is a great app and I would recommend it even though I have a few things I would have done differently for me.
671,2019-04-05 01:28:42,5,I love this app. It make it so easy to fall asleep after a busy day or relax and meditate before school or work. I love to listen to the ocean waves or babbling brook while I read. I don’t like to be angry or upset and this app helps me calm down. It is so easy to find what you are looking for because of its layout. The sleep stories are really nice and they come out with new ones every update (which I think is every week). I just wanted to say thank you to everyone behind Calm and help people trying to decide whether to download it or not. I love this app.
672,2019-01-16 05:26:11,5,"Words can’t express how much I love Calm. It is easily the best app on my phone. I think I’m an OG user, I’ve had the paid subscription of Calm since 2014 and I love it to this day. The app is incredibly easy to use, has a TON of meditation options, and helps you easily manage and track your progress.  I liked the old voice of Calm better, but after emailing the team, they reinstated the old set of guided meditations on my app. I hope they don’t ever get rid of it! This app is better than Headspace and I promise I’m not affiliated with either company. Thanks for developing this gem!"
673,2018-10-13 14:18:38,5,"I have been dealing with some serious health issues, which in turn creates anxiety and sleeplessness. I am not sure what I would have done without the Calm app these last few weeks. I can finally sleep at night. I put my headphones on, listen to a bedtime story, and then the app plays calming background music and sounds for an hour. It’s also extremely helpful for getting me back to sleep once I have woken in the middle of the night. Anyone with anxiety knows that it’s really hard to fall back asleep. Calm calms the circus in my head. Worth every penny."
674,2018-10-29 23:46:32,2,"My husband and I were looking for an app that might have some good sleep stories. We found this and at first we liked about a half a dozen different stories we heard but after that it was disappointing.
 The stories are mostly not interesting; remember you are listening to the first five or 10 minutes before you fall asleep (hopefully) of it so you do want the story substance to be a little bit engaging. I think the problem is that the made up stories are just so poor. The stories that are good are the ones that somebody else wrote that might be an excerpt from a book or a fairytale. Stick to those stories guys, because your made up stuff is bad.
Also Tamara Levitt's baby talk is very annoying."
675,2021-01-26 01:40:30,5,"I use headspace often, love it. But I have been curious what Calm is about and I have to say I enjoy this app as well. I am an insomniac and easily anxiety prone and so I wanted to see if this app could provide me something different then headspace. What I like so far is the daily calm and the fact that I can put my mood, gratitude and insights into the software daily, almost like a journal. Helps me to slow down at the end of the day and reflect. I think I like the sleep stories in headspace a bit better, but with both apps I can get the best of both worlds."
676,2018-04-18 19:48:01,4,"I use the thunderstorm sound on the free version of this app every night to help me fall asleep. I used to use the body scans, but Calm recently locked those out to non-subscribing members, which is very disappointing because I can’t afford to pay for the app and the body scans were extremely soothing. I’ll be using a different app now for body scans. That being said, if you can afford this app, I recommend it, but for those of us who can’t, all of the nature sounds and meditation music is still free, along with a (now much smaller) collection of free meditations"
677,2020-12-14 22:08:07,5,"I've been using the calm app for several years. I started with the seven days of calm, which was free, and once I got into the daily habit, I splurged for the annual subscription which I have been paying for a couple of years. I really enjoy the Daily Calm. I love Tamara's voice and her meditations really make me stop, think, and stay in the moment. My one criticism is that she often mispronounces fairly common words which kind of drives me crazy. Somebody needs to help her with that! It can be jarring. It's the only reason I'm not giving the app five stars."
678,2019-12-07 16:22:57,5,"My mind wanders, as does most, when I try to get to sleep. I’m also a single mother of four grown kids and a high school teacher. Yoga breathing helps a lot when I try to sleep but sometimes i need more. The Calm app saves me. I love falling asleep to the stories. It takes my mind off life’s problems. Even when I’m up during the night I put it right on and it helps me stay calm and able to sleep once again. I’m so relieved going to bed knowing I’ll hear a calming story. I’m better during the day as well. I’m not as agitated. I highly recommend those app."
679,2020-06-18 04:08:36,4,"this app is awesome if ur looking for something to help u sleep or relax! my favorite part about the app is the stories and soundscapes! but theres one thing about the app that i dont like. for one they take a long time to add another new story to the app AND when they do the stories haven't (recently) even been stories. i really like the storie like the snow queen, the velveteen rabbit, and beauty and the beast. and also they came out with the little princess part one like forever ago and they keep putting out stories like australians
coral coast and twilight to moon like... those are documentaries! ik i just ranted but overall i rly love this app and its rly helped me!😘"
680,2019-10-23 11:39:59,5,"I’m nearly through my first month of incorporating the Calm App into my daily life. I was never good at meditation on my own, but find it much easier with the guidance Calm provides. I use it every morning to stretch and meditate, in the afternoon for music and in the evening sometimes for the stories but mostly to meditate before bed. I find my self really noticing when I want to react and then letting it go before I even have a chance to. I’m a mom of a toddler and even though he is really chill there are still those days where this App is my saving grace."
681,2019-05-24 18:21:33,5,"This app is very calming and relaxing. I enjoy listening to the water on the home page, and I recommend you to listen to the 24 minute long relaxation session, Blue Gold, and set a time for every day, unless you’re like me and want to stay up on the weekends, to be the same so you can get healthy, nice sleep. I highly recommend this app if you’re someone who has stress, anxiety, trouble focusing, trouble sleeping, or maybe you’re someone who just wants some space, alone time, or peace and quiet. Whatever it is, this app is sure to help. “Calm” is a great app. You should get it! 💙😁"
682,2019-05-08 05:30:09,5,"I’m a diagnosed insomniac and I have been put on loads of different types of medications, none of them work. I either get a lot of drowsiness or cat seem to fall asleep. This app has taking a perfect mixture and puts me to bed yet still not into a incredibly deep sleep so I can easily wake up in the early hours to work. My one wish is that I didn’t have to pay to get the good stuff. The subscription is cheap and totally worth. One of my favorite apps today. Alan sklar is super great. And I love phoebe smiths stories. Wonderful all around. I would give it a 4.5 stars but I can’t. Anyhow great app."
683,2019-01-17 04:42:01,5,"This is the very best meditation & relaxation app available. I rarely review anything. I had to for this app. Truly, I am stunned at the results of this app at helping me with my life long insomnia. The deep sleep meditation sessions work. I had the free version for about a year before I finally bought the subscription. Now, I meditate at minimum 4 days a week, fall asleep faster then I ever have & am learning a lot about mindfulness. Plus the music to relax or fall asleep to is my favorite. I use it for my husband & I every night & our baby. Our son loves it! Get this app! You will not regret it."
684,2019-03-23 12:46:21,4,"You’ve made Daily Calm available on the watch, Great!  I would probably use this all the time.  The problem is, I used it and when I went back the next day to the phone app discovered the previous days session had not been recorded.  My streak had been broken.  Now, I don’t live and die by the streak.  It’s just a little added incentive to keep you going and I simply added the session manually.  I shouldn’t have to do this though and it seems a glaring oversight on your part not to have IWatch sessions updating our records on the main app when we use it."
685,2019-03-21 23:00:09,3,"The concept of this app is great, and I’m glad to see that they’re growing. However, I had a few problems. 

The app glitched out. A LOT. I know it wasn’t my phone or Internet connection. But I could barely get through any of the stories or meditations without the app freezing and closing at least once. I loved the meditations and stories, but it was really annoying when this happened every ten minutes or so. 

Next: the lack of free content. I understand that they need to make money like any other business. However, I am not willing to pay for a subscription. This seemed to affect a lot of different things on the app, as I could barely do anything. As I said, I understand that they have to make money, but they also have to realize that there are users out there who can’t pay. There’s not a lot you can do without this, which really saddened me. 

The idea is wonderful. It’s easy to use and the services are nice. I wouldn’t call it a five star app, but it’s okay. I’d encourage you to still try it out. Judge for yourself!"
686,2018-10-05 21:37:24,5,"In addition to implementing good sleep hygiene ( blackout shades, earplugs, going to sleep and getting up at consistent times, yoga, meditation), my Sleep Stories on my Calm App have saved me ! It was worth paying the yearly fee so I can listen to a variety of the sleep stories . They definitely put me to sleep by the end of the story. I bought a special Bluetooth one ear ear Dabs ear bud so I can fall asleep on my side and not hassle with old fashioned wires on my headphones. I was able to kick the Ambien nightly too! Worth a try for those who find the monkey brain keeping you up"
687,2018-06-28 06:15:32,5,"Okay, so I got this app mostly out of curiosity from all the ads about it. Although the ads were annoying, they were promising so I decided to give it a shot. I do not regret doing so. Although you can pay or sign up for more content, the app already provides enough to help you calm down without any extra fuss. As a student with depression and anxiety, this app helps me calm down when I am having a difficult time. Never have I seen an app that sticks to its namesake more than this one. Trust me, get this app. It’s free, it’s good, and it’s worth it."
688,2018-08-03 13:49:58,3,"I really enjoy this app. Bought it a year ago and just started using it. I'm pretty sure I bought the expensive one so when I updated my app after 7 days of use I found it extremely frustrating that they locked me out of some of the session I was already using. Luckily I have the app one my iPad and iPhone and will definitely not be updating the one on my iPhone. Shame on you, developers. These sessions should be grandfathered in seeing I already paid for them. Add some new ones and lock those for alll I care!! Don't lock me out of sessions I'm already using. I won't be renewing my subscription. Will look for new apps."
689,2017-08-30 15:33:59,5,"I was miserable at night due to my insomnia. Then I discovered the 25 minute body scan. I either am so awake that I listen to the whole scan, which at least relaxes me, or somehow the sound of her voice lulls me to sleep, or back to sleep. Its so typical of my monkey mind that sometimes I worry that the body scan app will be discontinued or the app won't be around, and then I'd be lost again. Then I'd be  back to Ambien, which I hardly use anymore, and horrible, sleepy, sick-feeling days!!! Time to listen to the app again, right? Thank you for such a great app!"
690,2021-01-13 03:21:44,5,Thank you for how supportive you’ve been and you help me fall asleep every time nothing doesn’t stop me from sleeping in your app. My parents separated when I was 3 years old and I miss my dad slit and wouldn’t be able to fall asleep. At first I used to think calm was for grandmas who have sleep issues but I learned there are different meanings to this app and many of them are helpful to me. Once again thank you so much for this app you have created I’m only one of the many people you have helped with the same kind of problem.
691,2021-03-02 00:57:41,4,"Been using the app for over a year now.  Let me just say, it helps my 5 year old with naps and bedtime.  Our favorite sleep stories are Luna’s Lullaby, Ella’s Treasure by Tamara Levitt.  It works like a charm every time.  My only gripe is that, for some odd reason, the developers have not  bothered to updated the Apple TV version.  Unlike the iPhone and iPad version, there is no search option and a very limited amount of content available.  Honestly, it’s kind of annoying having to airplay sleep stories from my iPhone and iPad.  It’s for this very reason why I’m giving a four start rating."
692,2020-12-08 15:44:34,5,"1.I came to this sight via a friend...my life had been experiencing my first divorce and it was such a painful experience. But the Daily Calm was my wake up daily call.....thank you so much for these moments!

2. Here I am months later still using this wonderful way to Calm as it’s my way of starting my day! I get the coffee ready sit down for a moment and quiet myself and go through the morning ritual of sitting quiet listening to the news making sure the world is stable and then turning on Calm and taking a moment to meditate!"
693,2019-10-09 02:53:29,5,"I have found this app to be the best meditation app of the bunch. I have been using it since 2016. There are two features I would love to see added. 1) show time for all meditation options prior to selecting (view the amount of time before a selection has been made) and 2) allow for a more cohesive sorting option (or something similar; the selections for themes that display above are not categorized well and a sort + filter option would fix both of these issues).

Overall love the app!"
694,2020-04-06 18:04:32,2,"I’m 15 and I have pretty bad anxiety and has trouble sleeping. I got this app to help me relax enough to have a good day or to even just sleep through the night. I’m a teenager and I don’t have a job, especially not now with the whole corona situation. I can’t pay over $60 even if it is yearly I don’t have that money NOW. And the stuff that you are able to do doesn’t help that much there is no sleep stories nothing to just listen to. The only thing there is, is “the learn how to meditate” and I already know how I had another app that reached me but I didn’t have the motivation to just sit there for 30 mins and do nothing. I had hoped this could help me but I can pay for it. It seems like a really good app but just not for me ❤️"
695,2020-01-03 00:02:51,3,"I used Calm for many years. I already meditate, so I didn’t use many of the meditation programs. I liked the idea of a daily meditation, such as the Daily Calm, but I can’t abide the speaker’s voice. It is so affected, I longed for different voices. (Others must have spoken up, because some of the sleep meditation assistance used other voices, but I found those dry and clinical.) The most distressing aspect about the app is its commercialism. I really don’t care about movie stars and famous people being recruited for sleep story narration and trainings. But that seems to be the direction Calm is headed. I liked it for a long time. I just found far more variation and less commercialization elsewhere."
696,2018-08-27 22:55:58,5,"I learned how to meditate using this app - it just requires daily practice and not setting expectations for yourself. Allow the app to guide and teach you. Don’t give up after a few first days, it may take longer. 

I use this app to manage my anxiety, and the tools I got from the book called “DARE: a new way to end anxiety and panic attacks.”  I have found tremendous positive results from the combination.

I would love to see some promos for for discounts on their yearly subscription, or possibly a one time lifetime fee. Other apps offer that, but I have yet seen one for Calm."
697,2021-02-21 15:45:11,2,"I’ve been using this app for about 3 months. The beginning meditation course is really great and worth taking. Also like the sleep stories. But I will not be renewing. Should have gotten 1-2 months instead of a year. Here’s why:

TLDR: App is poorly designed; make sure you like Tamara Levits way of speaking before subscribing bc she’s 90% of the guided meditations:

1) The app is very confusing to navigate, which when half asleep is especially frustrating. I surprised that there is no one clear place to see all of your saved/fav recordings. Also, ever meditation has a huge picture which seems ok for people new to the app, but unnecessary for whose who just want to find what they're looking for. These things can easily be fixed and I hope they do something about it. 

2) After I finished beginning mediation course, I realized 90% of the other guided meditations  are by Tamara Levitt. I understand a lot of people probably like how she speaks (vocal fry, trying too hard to sound soothing), but I find it too distracting. So basically I can’t listen to 90% of the guided meditations."
698,2018-03-04 18:11:13,1,"The woman's voice is not soothing. She is annoying like she doesn't want to be there. Also, you don't learn anything. If you want to learn how to meditate, I assume you have to pay but I am not going to spend money to find out it is no better than the free. And, I did like the scenes and sounds I thought were relaxing and could help if I learn to meditate somewhere else. But, now I have access to only 3 of them.  Do I have to pay to get the others? No thanks. The master classes seemed interesting, but you have to pay (once again). You could probably find some things on-line to read or in video for free. Did not pay a penny and so glad I did not. These seems like it is the biggest rip-off. What I want to know is how much Calm paid to get such a high rating."
699,2017-12-20 12:51:07,1,"After installing I was able to use one time for around 15 minutes. The next time I went in and selected the beach theme the app displayed spinning wheel then shut down. After that I could no longer open and use any app as the same thing occurred for all apps. Rebooting did not help. I had to utilize apple support and install an update via connecting to my computer, which ended up taking several attempts before I could finally get the phone to stay on and able to accept the update. I had not downloaded any other apps or installations or updates at all. After the iOS update I was able to remove the app and have had no issues with the phone since.

Beware!I would not even try this app again."
700,2021-02-10 09:19:12,5,"I love this app. Some nights I drift away to the gentle sound of the ocean, mesmerized as each wave invites me to enter uninterrupted sleep. My favorite is the crickets and meadow stream; I feel like I am camping and the song of the crickets shut out every stressful thought that tries to infringe on much needed rest. The purring cat is soothing during the day, and comforting when I am alone grading papers. I pass on the washing machine and do not find it relaxing. Anyone that enjoys the sounds of nature or struggles with insomnia needs this app. I am sleeping better than I have for years."
701,2021-01-21 16:38:55,5,"I love this app. The only thing that would improve is being able to have a que for listening.  So I could do a short meditation, that immediately goes into a sleep story, then  turn on one of the sound scapes.  If I’m on the edge of sleeping but the story ends and I realize it,  I will wake up to put another one on.  I use the sound scapes a lot to drown out noise that wakes me up, but that doesn’t work if I fall asleep listening to a sleep story.  So makers please add this feature.  I can’t be the only one that would like this."
702,2020-11-21 03:40:09,5,"I waited to test a few sessions before reviewing. I don’t know how, but it works. Every single time I start listening and think, I will be so frustrated in 27 minu ..zzzzz. In short, I never make it to the end of the story or the meditation. I have melatonin, magnesium, trazodone, ativan, Tylenol PM, tryptophan, valerian tea... I’m sure I forget something. Nothing works like this app, to include the prescription trazodone (gives me a stuffy nose as a side effect so that’s that). I actually look forward to my night story. I wish they had some cooling meditation.  Buy it."
703,2020-08-04 13:51:16,5,"As a graduate student in law school, stress is a major factor in my everyday life. Meditation has been a game changer for me. I complete a session in the morning to start my day. I have never been happier or more relaxed in my life. Just give meditation a shot, especially with the calm app, and you will be so very glad you did. In today’s crazy and fast-paced world, taking a few minutes out of your day in mindfulness with provide you with priceless benefits. The Calm app is so easy to use and has a plethora of content. 5/5 recommend!"
704,2020-07-20 23:18:37,5,"I would like to know that I have Calm premium now on the app & I was wondering if you have any sleeping noise machine available also on the app.

Now that I have it I will go through of how you’re feeling, Breathing exercise and Learn the basics of mindfulness medication. I would love to know if you have the sleeping on the app. I can’t find the sleeping without talking & just sleeping calmly. All it does the narrator talks every time. I don’t have control over that?? Can someone please explain about this app Calm. I would love to know if you have the noise machine which is sleeping"
705,2020-02-16 02:11:03,5,"I’m a critical care nurse. I work long hours often punctuated by adrenaline and stress. I’ve also struggled on and off with insomnia since I was a kid. The app is a fantastic resource to have in my pocket, both at work & after. I always go to bed with my phone, often using it in ways that make rest harder as I try to will myself into being tired. This is the perfect replacement behavior— bad sleep hygiene habits naturally swapped out with better ones through the same medium I’ve been using at bedtime for years. Totally worth the premium subscription."
706,2020-01-26 04:45:29,5,"I love this app, I never thought I would actually try and meditate because I never thought it would have an impact on my life. I was wrong, it changed everything for the best. But for sleep I light to listen to “Thunderstorm”, only thing I don’t like about it is the thunder isn’t loud enough. I like to listen to loud thunder or sudden sounds when I sleep but it’s hard to find this kind of stuff when there isn’t a search bar. I would love this app even more if there was one. I hope I’m not the only one. Thanks for such a great app!"
707,2018-11-07 22:20:11,5,I recently hurt the feelings of someone I was close to by being mindless and not upholding my end of responsibility. In apologizing I asked what I could do. It was asked that I work on getting better. I took this to heart. Another friend told me his therapist recommended this app. It has been worth the price as I am feeling myself becoming less chaotic and more stable. It’s nice to have something to do to work on bettering my life. It’s nice to be guided and kept on a schedule. I especially like the mindfulness class on relationships with others. It’s worth it. You are worth it. 🍃
708,2019-09-22 04:58:40,2,"You have to pay for everything... there’s only around 2 things you don’t have to pay for... I recommend another app... I loved it when I had my free trial where I got a free story every night for a few weeks but after that it kinda just was just me listening to the things my souls machine would make... however it’s awesome for a portable sound machine because if you just pick which background sound (you will understand if you purchase) you like, and then go to the meditation part and it will just play that sound for however long you set it... but that’s really all you can do if you don’t do the whole subscription thing and all the monthly payments"
709,2019-08-30 04:42:49,3,"I want to love this app; but I don’t. I like aspects of it but I don’t love it. Anything by Tamara Levitt I have to skip. Unfortunately, her voice is grating, nasal and it sounds flippant, often too perky—especially in the sleep meditations or sleep stories—and cloying. I wish there were options to choose different voices on a particular meditation. I primarily got this app for the sleep meditations… And all but one seems to be lead by Tamara. I enjoy some of the sleep stories, but it’s the same there as well,  these narrators need to mellow out...we’re trying to wind-down. I may not keep my subscription if they don’t expand to provide voice/speed choices, especially with the hefty price tag!"
710,2019-07-19 01:09:16,1,"They let you download it for free but there is basically nothing available unless you upgrade to the very expensive $60+/year pro version. None of the music is available free. There were just two “meditations” available for free but the one I listened to was not even a meditation. The first session explained what anxiety is, said it’s common and talked about how the woman would give tools to help overcome anxiety. That’s all fine, but it’s not a typical guided meditation with breathwork, relaxing encouragement, etc. I understand I’ve judged the app critically pretty quickly and without fully experiencing what it had to offer in the pro version. But I found it frustrating that it is advertised as free but it really isn’t. I wish it were more affordable."
711,2019-06-16 04:26:33,1,"If your like me and don’t have any money to spend on apps you would say the exact same thing as me, which is that this app has to little options in it for anything, there are very few things on this app and it costs to much to unlock everything else. Since I downloaded it, I have been wanting to do the 7 days of sleep program, it is a total lie, it gives you 1 session and you have to pay for the other 6 sessions. Also it gives you about 7 meditation things you can do and the are the same, you get 1 session and have to pay for the rest. There are literal tons of things you can do in this app, but you have to pay for almost all of them. For free, the app gives you about 8% of the whole app."
712,2019-05-07 13:14:42,4,"I love the sleep stories. They usually put me right to sleep, and if I don’t fall sleep within the story, I’m so relaxed that I fall asleep soon after. The only reason I gave this app a 4 and not a 5 is because you can’t just purchase single sleep stories; you have to get a monthly subscription. So, I’ve been listening to the same 2 free stories since I found this app. Now it’s just 1 free story. I don’t need a monthly subscription, but if you need this to help fall asleep every night, then I guess the subscription might be worth it. Message to the Calm app people: Let us purchase single stories. Please!"
713,2018-10-30 11:57:15,5,"Here is a excerpt from my meditation journal “I like to meditate and relax to a slower state and before the calm app, I was not able to do this on my own. The calm app was recommended by my counselor and had definitely helped in aiding me to begin my journey of self. For that I am grateful, for the awakening. Happiness is in the now. I have a great life worth living. And oh, there is magic if you are in the moment, you only need to concentrate”. <- I would not even be able to relate to this person a couple months ago. Thank you Calm for breaking chains and binding up hearts! I love this app!!!"
714,2018-07-20 18:05:15,5,"I absolutely love this app & what it is all about, it’s just so frustrating that EVERYTHING is locked after the first session. You find meditations that you think are for the free version, and you take the first lesson and the rest are locked until you pay for the subscription. Just make your app cost something instead of making people think they can benefit from this without paying. The only thing you can actually do is 7 days of calm, & timed meditations. All the other meditations are locked."
715,2017-12-10 15:08:05,5,"Calm is broken. Since the latest update, the app will not open on my iPhone 7 Plus or iPad Air, both running iOS 11.2. This morning, I deleted and reinstalled the app on the iPad. Now when I try to log in, Calm tells me to try again when I have a faster Internet connection! Speedtest app shows my speed to be 193 mbps!! Surely that is fast enough for Calm. Now I am screwed because I have an annual subscription to Calm which I am certain cannot be refunded and I cannot use the app. So sorry to see something I really used and enjoyed go bad."
716,2017-09-18 13:13:45,5,"The Calm app is one I try to use daily. It's incredibly user-friendly and gives me all I need to destress for my day. There are plenty of free meditation sessions but it also offers other more advanced guided sessions for a fee. My children LOVED the bedtime stories sessions - it really helped them to calm down before bed. My favorite feature is the ability to change out the sensory-style home screen to whichever ""live-action"" scene you choose with the associated relaxing sound. They have now added music as another great option to help meditate."
717,2017-08-30 23:25:16,5,"It might be hard to get into, but if you commit to this app it will pay you back in many, many ways. Personally, I struggle with anxiety, as well having issues with self-esteem and self-degradation. When my therapist recommended this to me, at first I was skeptical, especially considering the financial commitment. But once I gave this app a chance I was not disappointed. Don't expect immediate results; it will take work to be life-changing. But by putting in the effort you will truly improve yourself with time and patience."
718,2017-09-13 14:19:41,4,"I have depression and anxiety. I have been seeing a therapist, studying up on self help books, and trying to watch meditation videos online. This app was recommended to me on Facebook and I'm so glad. I've only been using it for a few days, but the guidance in the sessions makes me feel not so alone on this journey. The guidance and varieties of meditation on the app is lovely. I also listened to one of their sleep stories and didn't even realize I had fallen asleep until I woke up the next morning. I'd really recommend this to anyone new to meditation or looking for some self help and/or self love."
719,2020-11-22 15:24:01,3,"I have found great calm and concentration from meditating, although, it often is helpful to have a guiding voice. I download calm and am inundated with “you NEED to turn on push notifications”, “set a mindful reminder”, “rate us now”, “do a daily check-in” AHHHHHH! All I’d like to see is good content and not a junk app which breeds anxiety with trying to hug you to death. I love this concept. I don’t like the main individual, I find the daily calm to be almost pontificating how to sit, think, and be. It’s more instructive and for some dude who just wants to relax it’s frustrating being told how to be. I know it’s all in good faith but cmon ppl this is like a drugstore selling cigarettes."
720,2020-08-13 06:26:11,5,"I’ve been dealing and healing with PTSD and this app has helped me more than anyone can give it credit for. I personally pay for the premium plan because it’s worth it. When I feel the anxiety coming on I turn to this app for a quick fix. It takes time, but this has become my safe space. The sleep-time stories help more than I’d ever imagine. Definitely don’t knock something until you try it. Entirely grateful for the developers, you’re definitely part of my healing journey.  

Btw I’d love to read a story to one day!"
721,2020-08-24 19:58:31,4,"This app seems to make me feel better so far. It’s calming. I wish that there was more free things. I would pay for the subscription but that’s a lot of money every year, and your not getting much. I’ll stick with the free stuff, though it’s not much. I wish that you could listen to free sounds and listen to more free meditations. Over all this app is set up really well and is stress reliving. I love the mood check in’s. It’s nice to write what your feeling. I also like to use the breath bubble. Please make more free things, I would enjoy this app %100 if you did. 🥺🥺🥺 

Update:

This app is making me happier!!! I LOVE IT."
722,2020-07-21 10:47:16,5,"Last night my kids were bouncing of the walls, crying, arguing and complaining and doing anything not to sleep.  I had read to them and let them listen to their audible book, but they refused to relax into sleep. I sat down in their room, told them to lay down, but they were incapable of quieting, so I turned on the meditation gently to sleep and within 10 mins we were all falling asleep. Haha! I tried to leave then and my 9 year old said she was still awake calmly and half asleep. 5 more minutes and she was out."
723,2020-07-11 23:23:14,5,"Hi I have anxiety and I recently downloaded this app for sudden anxiety attacks,meditations,and for easy sleep. I honestly thought that calm would be like any other meditation app. But I was proven wrong. Calm really connects with their consumers. One day I was on a road trip and I remember having a anxiety attack about something I just simply taped on a meditation and it worked so well I’m so soososososoosos happy I downloaded calm. And paying every month for exclusive meditations, sleep stories, and soothing sounds is SO worth it. Thank you developers at calm for making life easy!🤗💜👍"
724,2019-12-01 14:49:19,5,"The Calm app is one of my favorite apps. I like the 10 minute meditations. It’s like hitting “refresh” for the mind. It’s easy for my mind to go down the rabbit hole of negativity. I reset it with a short meditation. 
     It also offers other features like sleep meditations or stories, focused meditations for anxiety, relationships, personal growth, and more. It allows you to select what you need. That maybe music or nature sounds or longer meditations.
     The app is designed well, is easy to use, and functions without crashes or problems.
     Enjoy Calm."
725,2020-03-28 03:10:37,2,"So, I’ve seen the ads for this app, and I’m deeply disappointed 😔. I love that you can personalize it and stuff, it even gives you a Q&A beforehand, so they know what’s right for you. I get done with the questions, and open it up, before I look at ANY of the stories, it asked me to get a subscription..... and I thought that subscriptions were optional (that’s were I was wrong), I started looking at all the stories and I see that EVERY SINGLE ONE is locked until you subscribe. Not a single story is free.
And I was really excited to get this app, and it was a complete disappointment. I just feel like there needs to be a “free stories ” section for the people (like myself) who can’t afford a subscription."
726,2020-01-11 21:26:59,3,"I love this app and recommend it to anyone who need some calm in their life. However, I’m very displeased with all the name dropping of famous people. Today’s meditation quoted Taylor Swift and a few before quoted LeBron James. This seems very commercial and unnecessary. I use this app to help get away from the world and find myself being extremely irritated by the included quotes, which I can only assume are included merely because they are famous and perhaps giving money to the company. If I wanted nuggets of wisdom from famous people I would follow them on Instagram or Twitter. In my opinion, this app is just becoming another platform for rich and influential people. It makes me sad."
727,2020-12-15 06:44:47,5,"Calm is awesome. As someone who has tried every drug on the planet to fall asleep (and usually without success), who would have thought that the quiets and most reliable way to fall asleep was a sleep story. I’ve been using Calm for 2 years now and will likely be a subscriber until the day I die. 

Guided meditations are also great. I really like the Daily Calm. It means that every day there is something new to listen to and each day I learn new things thanks to the theme of the Daily Calm that day. I’m continually impressed."
728,2018-06-07 06:53:47,4,"This app is amazing. The sleep stories are super helpful when I’m trying to drift off to sleep but need something to focus on for a little to keep my mind from wandering. While I love the app for its wonderful calming music and the sleep stories, I wish it has a timer for the music/sounds you can choose on the main page. I want nothing more than to fall asleep to the calming music or the cracking fire, but I always end up waking up later on in the night and eventually turning it off. I wish there were a timer for it so I could set the soothing sounds and have it turn off on its own."
729,2019-11-05 16:39:05,5,As mentioned this is my first time using this app Calm and I’m already feeling a sense of calm I didn’t believe it would work honestly my therapist has been telling me to try it and I hadn’t until today . Although I’ve only done one session after having a panic attack but I’m feeling 100% better I will definitely be using this app everyday . It mentioned something about a subscription though I really hope I don’t have to buy that to keep going because I don’t have the money .
730,2020-12-15 06:09:40,3,As much publicity meditation gets from Hollywood and the people you will see in the app. I can't help but be bothered that there's nothing I can click on that doesn't require me signing up for premium. Yes there's a 7 day free trial but how annoying I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so ungreaful yall but people are in so much pain!! I myself almost lost my leg a month ago and I'm in excruciating pain! But I just think this is a time when people who tend to stick to certain agendas actually go above and beyond to not be so superficial actually be the change for once. I'll probably end up signing up but not before I get this off my chest.
731,2019-12-10 22:25:25,4,"I love this app. I fall asleep quickly to the stories when I used to need silence to sleep. There’s new content added often, which keeps me from getting bored. Now I’m going to sound mean here, but I want to be honest: Tamara Levitt’s voice is unbearable. Her voice is not soothing, it’s grating. So any content she is on—which is most of the actual meditations—I just can’t listen to. Because it irritates more than calms me. I really wish I could do the meditations, but I just can’t get into them and feel their effects when she’s guiding them."
732,2019-09-26 15:29:50,5,"The Calm app has been incredibly helpful for me to develop a mediation practice. I had tried off and on for over 20 years to try to Set aside time and develop a meditation practice, but it has never been very consistent for me until I started using the Calm app. Having the ability to turn into a daily meditation and set goals to complete the meditation programs has given me the framework to develop a consistent practice. If you are struggling with motivation, dedication, or education about beginning a meditation practice, I highly recommend the Calm app."
733,2019-03-18 12:27:00,5,I was quite skeptical of all meditation therapy until a close friend said we should look into it as we have similar problems with anxiety and/or panic attacks. I’m going to honestly say I downloaded this and barely remember but after I did a few sessions it’s something that is detrimental to me getting through the week with positive mental health. Calm has been one of the larger catalysts to me slowing my attacks and anxiety to almost zero. If I’m unable to meditate I can still pull Tamara’s voice from my head and focus on my breath! Def reccomend!
734,2019-02-14 15:52:51,5,"So, I got this app for sleep. My teacher mentioned the sleep stories.  The sleep stories have totally helped me get to sleep faster. Once you get into the mind frame to listen it is my experience within 10-20 min you’re asleep. I actually now have explored the app more and the mediation part is awesome.  I used to use another app that used a lot of cartoons to convey ideas but this app is more my style where people talk and you listen.  Also, there’s a section for moving the body with videos.  This is definitely the best app out there."
735,2018-11-12 05:04:26,5,"I used to have a sound machine as a kid that I almost found it impossible to sleep without it. To this day I have to have some kind of background noise in order to sleep. I just downloaded the app today and I was absolutely amazed by it. It is exactly what I have been looking for. The very first time I opened the app, I got this deep warmth within my soul that I just couldn’t shake. It made me more relaxed within 5 minutes than I could do on my own. The sounds seem to be endless and I am going to enjoy this app for years to come."
736,2018-05-08 18:41:57,5,"So I was looking into apps that help make relaxing noise to study to, and this app is a gem. Little did I know that it had free meditation lectures as well. Harvard did a study and linked meditation sessions like these to a long list of positive results. For the list, check it out (for free) meditation day 1 of 7 in a 10 minute audio session. It literally brought tears to my eyes the first time I meditated successfully with it's help. Awesome app. Special shout out to all involved in the making of this app. Thank you! I hope more positivity is to come. :D"
737,2018-01-05 16:29:10,5,"I have the free sessions that Calm provides with the download of the app and I like it so far. I like that there are series to stay caught up with and that it tells you how long you meditated, how many sessions you’ve completed and your daily streak. It allows me to focus on trying to meditate at least once a day. I also enjoy the fact that you can set a reminder to meditate at the same time each day. The voices that guide you through are also very enjoyable. If I continue to enjoy the app I plan on purchasing a subscription."
738,2017-11-27 11:08:34,5,"This app has been life changing. I’ve dealt with anxiety all my life and I’ve always known meditation could help me handle it. But, for me, meditation has always been this elusive practice that I could never get in to. Until now. This app has made developing a realistic meditation practice a reality. I do a 10-minute session every morning, and spend several one-minute chunks breathing throughout my day while watching one of the landscapes. Finally, I end my day with a sleep story, some music, or another meditation. It’s been simply awesome. Thanks so much for this app!!"
739,2017-09-04 20:34:31,5,"I've been using this app for about 5 months and it has become my drug of choice. It fixes everything. 3:00 stress at work? Daily calm. Too stressed to sleep? Daily calm. In laws in town? Daily calm.
I rarely stick with anything this long, and I recommend it to literally everyone. I'm a type A working mom/weekend warrior/philanthropist/marathon runner/etc who found myself suddenly able to get out of bed. There was so much going on in my head I didn't know which way to move. Once I started Calm I was able to breathe again. I've learned to understand my emotions and calm myself. Flight cancelled and stuck in Miami? It's ok. I've learned how to breathe. Like today's Calm said, it's the tortoise who wins the race.
When I can't find my footing, I listen to a Daily Calm.
The guide's voice is also excellent. Not annoying. It's just right.
The length is just right.
The guidance is just right.
Thank you so very much!"
740,2021-03-01 14:41:43,5,"I love Calm and have used it before but had to stop for a bit due to funds.  On the very first night I came back to it, I woke up either due to insomnia or waking up to use the restroom or both but I struggled to relax and get back to sleep.  I opened the Calm app and put on one of the sleep stories and immediately was captivated not only by the story but how well it relaxed me and I got back to sleep easily.  This is a must have app and I plan on paying the lifetime membership fee when funds allow.  Just wonderful!   Keep up the amazing work Calm!"
741,2021-01-03 07:51:57,5,"I tired maybe 10 different meditations apps and after nearly a whole year of searching, I decided on this one. Even got the lifetime subscription for it since I personally hate to add to my monthly expenses and feel a lot more relaxed knowing that I’m not wasting my money by not using it “enough” in a month.

It has bells, nature sounds, music, stories, pretty backgrounds, it looks nice and it’s quite polished for an app. And yes, it has a good meditation collection as well as new daily ones. 

Some suggestions for future updates:

More nature sounds and higher resolution backgrounds.  Casting this app on tv would be great too. And I definitely would not complain if you would add binaural sounds option for those of us with headphones.

Overall, if anyone out there is still hesitating on which meditation/calming app to get, I would say: just get this one. It’s good and it gets updated regularly."
742,2021-01-05 18:14:42,3,"I have been using the free version for almost a year now. Money is tight with COVID-19 and today I went into to the sessions where they have the free sessions to listen to and practice meditation where locked and I now had to pay. It hurts that they would take things like this away. I had been hoping that when money wasn’t so tight I’d be able to get a paid membership, but I don’t know if I can trust them right now and feel they aren’t really trying to help people become less stressed and more mindful if they are practically forcing people to start paying to use their app when there is so much negative stuff still hanging around."
743,2020-06-15 00:05:23,5,"I’ve been using this app for a few weeks now. I decided that I wanted to start meditation and needed some guidance and I heard this app was good for beginners. The free trial was so awesome that for the first time I subscribed to a lifestyle app. I literally look forward to meditating everyday because of this app. The narrator is so calming and relaxing. Every feeling that I’ve had during the meditation she acknowledges and calms me down, it almost feels like she’s right next to me. Everything is just so approachable. I can’t wait to try out the sleep features."
744,2020-06-01 00:57:51,5,"This is the first app I’ve ever reviewed, i usually feel it’s useless to do but I had to submit one for Calm. I suffer from depression and major anxiety, to the point where I can’t breath and think. Everyone of my therapists have tried getting me to meditate but I could never make it work. Calm was the first app that helped me settle (calm) my mind. It taught me to be able to meditate even when Im not using the app. There’s also tons of other great uses as well. The sleeping aids help tremendously as well. I recommend this app completely!"
745,2019-11-08 11:06:09,5,My daughter and I both have anxiety and busy routines. She is a high school student. I am a middle school teacher. I started meditating with my students through Calm Schools. Meditation is a great way for me to either start my day or reconnect with my home life after a busy day at school. I teach math which can be frustrating for students. Meditation helps my students focus and have more control over their emotions during a turbulent phase of their development. Kids ask for meditation and prepare themselves for a session like experts.
746,2019-11-08 06:00:45,5,"I needed something to quiet my thoughts and help me wind down so I downloaded the free version that was recommended by a co-worker. I got tired of listening to just ""Blue Gold"" and ""rain on leaves"" but I enjoyed it enough to want to hear more stories and explore the app further. I planned on canceling the subscription once the free trial was over but to be honest it's worth the $$ once a year. The sleep stories always put me in a relaxed mental space and although the guided meditation is short is has made a positive impact on my practice. Definitely glad I didn't cancel."
747,2018-05-11 18:37:11,5,"I NEVER take time to write reviews OR pay for apps haha... this app..  has been a complete game changer.  I’m only a week down and the control of my thoughts and feelings have changed so much.  I feel lighter, happier, stronger.  I battle bad depression and my job is high stress.  This app is helping me learn how to manage stress. I thought that was impossible but I have a completely different outlook now.  And it gives you tools to help you throughout your day...  if you don’t buy apps.. this is worth saving money for.  #lifechanger"
748,2019-10-22 02:52:03,4,"My teacher had my classmates and I try this out whenever the class was getting rowdy and they were ruining there experience by talking over one of the meditation sessions and so I decided to try this app out on my own. Everything I tapped on literally came up with this thing talking about getting calm premium and there was barely anything free and at this point, I just felt like this whole calm premium thing was getting shoved down my throat. Despite that problem, I love the concept of this app and if anyone is reading this review, you should totally get this app if you plan on spending money on it💖"
749,2019-10-04 03:59:27,3,"The money, fr I can’t. It has great potential, the rates are looking splendid, however the problem for me is I want to do the 1 week trial but I have to pay which I ain’t probably going to be doing for a year. I understand you guys have to get paid but that’s just too much of a amount for a year. What should be fair is that people should always be able to have more options of testing the boundaries to see if it’s to their liking. My question is that what happens if I try all of the options of what is on the app and it hasn’t helped and I’m still not satisfied? All my money would’ve been wasted and for nothing."
750,2018-05-01 09:37:42,5,"So far I’ve done 114 sessions of the evening sleep process. Although I don’t do it exactly as prescribed where it says you should do your 10 minute meditation in a chair I actually do you mine lying in bed.  It’s the first thing I do before I go to sleep. After the 10 minute meditation I roll over on my side and listen to the sleep story. I rarely hear the entire sleep story before I’m fast asleep. Spoiler alert, I do take a sleeping pill and this practice seems to make it more effective. Looking forward to investigating more that the App has to offer."
751,2018-04-05 10:31:16,5,"This app is amazing.  Tamara had the most soothing voice and she is a great guide for meditation.  Whether you want to do just the daily calms or do one of the 7 day programs, they will all change you in some way shape or form.  I live in NYC and take the train every day to work, which tends to be very stressful.  Ever since I started using this app to meditate, I’ve noticed that I don’t get angry or frustrated anymore when the train is delayed.  I just listen to my music and go about my day :)

If you’re looking for some calm in your life, Tamara can help you get it!"
752,2018-03-22 10:40:22,5,"I have tried and failed to achieve a regular meditation practice with two other very popular apps. I had given up completely but for some reason the relaxed natural imagery of this app appealed to me. I tried the 7 day free trial and immediately afterwards paid the yearly fee. I have continued to meditate almost every day since. This app is incredible and the guided meditations hit the sweet spot between too much instruction, and not enough. If you have tried and failed with other meditation apps/books, definitely give this one a go!"
753,2018-03-15 14:02:32,5,"I was resisting meditation for a very long time. I can’t get enough of it now with this app! I tell everyone about it. You’re doing yourself an injustice by not subscribing to the full features. The 21 days of calm got me hooked. The guide and the lessons are well thought out and really work. My only wish is that they were a little longer :)
The app has so many features with the subscription that I haven’t even discovered all of them yet!
Enjoy your day and I hope this review helped you make a good choice for yourself and your wellbeing. 😊"
754,2020-06-03 19:24:34,5,"For the last 3 years I have had a lot of life changes.  Managing mind, health and body have been difficult.  I’ve closed in on addictive behaviors, depression and anxiety.  This app helps to keep some things in check for me; along with regular therapy sessions and checking in with my doctors.  I’m able to manage the harder parts of life without the use of medications.  I’m able to start making better choices that I believe will become better habits.  I enjoy the short yoga sessions and the stress management features."
755,2021-03-01 02:15:19,4,"As an educator, I’ve been using Calm for years to help my students unwind after standardized testing and to help me fall asleep. I love this app. I have favorite narrators, and if I have a hard time falling asleep, I know if I put on anything by Bhav, Alan, or Eric, I’ll be asleep in minutes. 

HOWEVER

This newest update has made Calm stay on the opening screen, and not move beyond “take a deep breath.” I can’t get to the sleep stories! And having gone through an interstate move and starting a new job in the past two weeks, my stress is at an all time high. Please, Calm, fix your app! Thank you!"
756,2021-02-01 16:47:50,3,"So I love the sleep stories. I think most people agree one persons relaxing voice can be grating to another. I don’t understand except from a guess that she started the app why the meditation section is totally dominated by one person in particular. And I’m sure there might be many that find her voice nice but personally I would like variety and am disappointed I pay for calm and while the sleep stories keep having a wide range of readers , for those of us who want to meditate it’s always the same person. Please expand on options. Especially in light if nothing else or cultural diversity etc"
757,2019-12-02 02:21:18,5,"I learned of Calm through a course I enrolled in on how to manage stress as a PHD student. Extremely effective for focus and relaxation-what I didn’t realize was how crucial it would be to my whole family. My daughter has anxiety and listens to nature sounds at night to fall asleep. My young sons have suffered broken bones and sports injuries, where the sleep stories helped eased their fears and fall asleep despite being in pain. I have recommended to so many, and feel that this tool has become a necessity for my family. Thank you Calm!"
758,2019-12-27 09:03:00,3,"Please update this app to let the user put sleep stories in a queue. I don’t understand why this isn’t a thing. I listen to a sleep story then wake up when it’s silent and playing another story requires I get my glasses and choose one and select it - thus waking me up fully. Also, please let us sort stories by length! I also wish I knew which narrators had a British accent and which ones don’t. I find the British accent to be not as relaxing some nights and I’d love to be able to sort by this. These are the things that will prevent me from renewing my subscription come 9/20 if they aren’t resolved - at least the queue issue."
759,2019-12-10 20:36:15,4,"I love, love, love the music for my children at night. It’s calming and easy to listen to. I love the guided meditations. The only reason I am not going to renew is because of one of the narrators. Tamara Levitt has a way of speaking that my ears can’t take. I hate saying that. I have tried to do a full session but her voice always comes across as over-done and fake to me. I can’t relax to it. I wish there were options for a different narrator. Now, I’m probably going to get bad karma for saying that but it’s the only part of the Calm app that I find frustrating."
760,2019-10-27 11:04:56,5,"I lost my husband suddenly last year.  Mornings were the worst part of my day for months & months.  I found the music on the Calm app helped soothe & settle my racing thoughts & emotions.  I wasn’t sleeping well so I always woke very early, I would sit on my deck with a cup of coffee & stare out at the fields & empty my mind of everything but the soothing music & beautiful scenery.  Thank you Calm for helping me through the hardest year of my life!  I have used this music on long flights & middle of the night worry sessions to help me find a bit of serenity."
761,2019-10-15 12:19:20,5,"This app, man, I can tell you has guided me through some of the toughest times in my life this past year. It’s taught me how to breathe. Yeah actually take full breaths, even when my anxiety wants to clench my breaths in. I love the streak system, it makes me keep on top of my game. Longest streak—25 days and counting! I’ve made Calm App a part of my morning routine. Definitely recommend the premium subscription. Definitely worth the 1 time a year cost and you get access to anything you want. I still have things to explore on this app!"
762,2019-10-06 13:36:03,5,"Just taking a few minutes a day to breathe and let go has brought so much mindfulness into my life.  One of the biggest benefits I have receive is self awareness, specifically being aware of the ways my body manifests stress and how that in turn causes more stress. When I am stressed I hold my mouth tight and clasp my hands. Then I feel more stressed. By recognizing this I have been able to breathe that stress away unclench my hands and relax my jaw. I run a charity for suicide prevention so there is a lot of stress in my life and this app is helping me through that."
763,2019-02-09 21:03:21,5,"My whole family uses this app almost daily and has changed our lives. There are so many different facets and parts of the app that service different people. My 13 yr d daughter loves the sleep stories, I have grown my meditation practice so much since I started using this app and my husband, who is new to Meditation, found the introductory sessions really helpful. I sometimes use the Calm app while also using my Core Meditation Trainer. It is an amazing combination if you are lucky enough to have the Core. Keep doing what you’re doing to Tamara!"
764,2019-02-18 18:34:45,3,"I really want to try this app but I’m one of those users that isn’t going to put my credit card/Apple Pay for anything. I prefer not trying it purely based on the process of needing to remember to cancel etc. That being said, I also have paid for apps before that are pure utility (navigation app for boating).

I really wish you guys would expose more of the content to the free version so I knew exactly what my ROI is. However the approach I think there’s too little content for a user to feel the full benefits. I’d like to see this adjusted so I can try more modules and move fwd. 

I love the space this Calm is in and hope you guys all the best."
765,2017-09-05 09:33:56,5,"My husband and I start our day drinking our coffee and watching CNN or other news programs...well, we did until it was unbearable. Now we meditate using the calm app. 
The 7 day programs are especially good and give great tips about focus, letting things go, and being less stressed. 
I also listen to the bedtime stories or music while drifting off to sleep. My husband's sleep stats on his Fitbit show he's having a better nights sleep too - less times restless and awake! 
Thx Calm app, especially Tamra. We love your voice 😏."
766,2017-08-25 15:00:37,5,"Have been a subscriber for about a year and a half. Tried some other meditation apps but find myself coming back to this one. I like that I can simply follow the meditation of the day or can select one or more sessions addressing a specific issue. There is no religious/based agenda. Regular use helps me to be more patient, compassionate and focused. And also productive strategies to deal with situations
when I'm none of those things. It's such a good value at the annual subscription price and right there on my phone when I need it."
767,2020-11-27 16:38:49,5,How can I continue to face the challenges of working as chaplain (emotional/psychological /spiritual support) during the many crises of a trauma center without my own balance? From one moment to the next I am looking into the eyes & hearts of a suffering humanity. Knowing we are not alone in our pain by connecting to another mitigates that challenging experience. I have been learning daily from my “Calm” app for nearly 2 years. And I am ever so grateful it was recommended to me each time I am able to return to the safe haven I find within.
768,2021-03-01 11:53:11,3,"I’ve had the calm app for a few years now. I love the sleep stories and have told many about them. However, in the past 2 months this app has been buggy beyond usable. I’ve had to uninstall and reinstall more than once, which is not what you want to deal with when you’re trying to wind down and sleep for the evening. The two main issues I’ve had are the app just not loading (staying on “take a deep breath” screen) or the scenes not playing in the background, which I use for white noise as I live in an urban area. 

Hope these bugs get fixed soon and permanently!!"
769,2020-09-29 13:59:48,5,I have struggled with near-constant disassociation for over 15 years now. I’m still in the free trial of this app but I have seen so much improvement already I am paying after my trial ends. I can’t remember the last time I felt like I really existed but I am remembering things in detail again like my walks listening to Calm. I’m not as anxious while working. In general keeping this apps lessons or music playing helps me focus and/or calm down. This app is changing my life and I’m so thankful for everyone involved in making it.
770,2020-11-17 07:47:06,1,"Why have a free version of this app? Just don’t offer one. I knew I couldn’t be the only person that was highly disappointed in the amount of content locked. Look, I’m all for you guys having a good product and charging for it’s service, but just don’t bother people with a version of it that is clearly worthless. I might of paid a smaller amount to download and been happy with some of the content still being locked, but to open the app and have access to so few things is a joke and a waste of time. Just rethink your approach to customers. Make it very transparent in your advertising that simply downloading the app is not going to be what they’re expecting. Very misleading and poor marketing. Shameful really."
771,2019-12-03 16:04:16,5,"When I first had Calm I did not expect it to work, because all of the apps that say that they can put you to sleep never worked, the other apps just had sound effects, and never really worked for me. Calm changed my amount of sleep time up a lot, even though I have the free version of Calm, I still always fall asleep to the same story. I recommend this app if you want to get better sleep, Calm is always my option if I can’t go to sleep, it reminds me of when I should go to sleep and wind down."
772,2020-06-05 04:54:47,2,"This app may seem great on the outside, but this is probably one of the most money-demanding apps I’ve ever seen. In the summer, I tend to sleep a lot less since it’s so  hot, which makes me uncomfortable. I’ve been wanting to better my sleep in the summer for years now, and Calm seemed like  the perfect solution. However, when I got the app, I quickly realized that 99% of ALL content is behind a paywall. This app might as well not even have any free audio and force you to get a subscription for access to anything. It is near impossible to find complete and free audio. I am a teenager, I need good sleep to function. Now, I am a few nights further from getting the amount of sleep I need."
773,2019-07-04 13:52:10,5,My brain is too active to sleep most nights. The sleep stories capture my attention enough to allow me to go to sleep and if I wake up I play another. I’m the stories are perfect for capturing just enough of my attention.. My favorite is Calm Airways. When I first started listening I would have to play two or three or more stories to get to sleep and wished I could make a playlist. Now my mind hears a story and it’s a good trigger that it’s sleeptime and I usually only need one story I highly recommend.
774,2018-11-25 03:16:44,5,"I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks. I have always refused prescriptions as a solution for fear of addiction and becoming a sedated version of my normal self. The Calm app has given me hope. When you enter the app it’s almost like escaping to your favorite spa, where for that moment you experience mental relaxation and bliss. The difference is the Calm app focuses on solutions to keep that moment from ending! I thank the creators of this app for giving me a peaceful escape, and hope that with practice - I will be able to overcome stressful days and restless nights."
775,2018-03-05 07:18:19,5,"I was watching tv and then saw this screen with water and the breathing bubble. It literally snatched my attention :) I started my free trial with Calm and I have not had a restless night since then. I wake up feeling so refreshed. The daily meditation helped me be aware of my stress level. I usually would never consider paying more than $10 for an app, but this app is worth it! I listened to all the samples, which were ok but then continued to want to try new stories at night and wanting to use my daily calm during the day."
776,2021-01-07 16:10:31,5,"This is a fantastic app and continually adds new content to and for sleep stories, meditations, classes , music and more. I especially like the daily Calm and the new Daily trip. I love Eric Braa and Jeff Warren’s soothing and clear voices. Some of the story tellers and speakers have voices that are difficult (for me) to hear or listen to, but these two men have wonderful voices, clear enunciation, and soothing speech. I love the constant updating of new material and variety. If a person is serious about calming their life, he or she will not regret purchasing this wonderful app."
777,2020-10-02 01:55:58,5,"This is easily my fav app. I’ve been using this app for almost two years now. Calm saved me from having a mental breakdown during distance learning. As an educator, this is a must app to have. With all the negativity that’s been happening in the world, calm makes me calm. I also love listening to other people’s perspectives on Spark. The daily calm is a part of my morning routine, sleep stories/meditation is a part of my evening routine. Amazing master class topics too. I just love everything about it. Thank you Calm. I appreciate all you do 🧘🏻‍♀️"
778,2020-12-16 05:10:07,4,"I use this almost exclusively for the sleep stories. I love the Lionwood stories. The developers should add a way to put the series of stories and the chapters of books in the same grouping. It’s not easy to tell by the title if Lionwood is in the story. Also, wheee is chapter 2 of Alice in Wonderland? I only see 1, 3&4.  And more chapters of The Little Princess please!!! 
I have used some of the other features:  series, music and meditation for self care and self improvement. 
The only reason I’m not giving five stars is for comments above about how to find sleep stories more easily."
779,2020-10-20 02:45:36,3,"When I saw this add I was like Oh this is gonna help me sleep so much! So I downloaded but realized that you have to BUY premium to even listen to stories which made me pretty upset..I’m begging you calm begging you! Please make it so some stories for sleeping available because I bet kids wanted to get this app just like me but kids don’t have money..! So it’s a little unfair..yes I sound like I’m a kid writing this well it’s because I am! Also I have a tip if u see this

Tip: if u turn on airplane mode when playing a game with LOTS AND LOTS of ads then all the ads will go away! Your welcome

Hopefully everyone is safe in quarantine Bc I’m writing this in quarantine lol ❤️💖✨❤️💖✨❤️💖✨❤️💖✨❤️💖✨"
780,2020-08-01 05:01:43,5,"I have tried several meditation apps and this is by far my favorite. The paid subscription is pricey but I have found it well worth the cost. I enjoy the techniques taught in the meditations to learn to accept emotions and let go of what doesn’t serve me. I love that the meditations don’t have music but you can choose a background sound as needed. Tamara has a very soothing voice. I also use the breathing bubble, the mood check-ins, and the master courses. Highly recommended! Thanks for such a great product!"
781,2020-08-03 10:11:23,2,"There are two options with this app: the free version which allots you very little or the premium version which is a commitment of over $50/month. Way too expensive for someone like me on a tight budget. I realize everyone needs to earn a living and it’s fair for the owners of Calm to set a value/price for their service, but it would be nice if they made it a little more universally accessible. A lack of money/inability to earn a livable wage is one of the biggest and most common sources of stress and turmoil a person can experience. It’s ironic that this app is one of the more expensive monthly subscriptions I’ve seen and is supposed to aid in stress-reduction. Frankly, it’s a little off-putting."
782,2020-01-26 18:41:58,5,I am an young athlete and stressed every minute. I do well in school and have big dreams but I am always so stressed if I will complete them. I just started and saw many ads about this. I kept putting it off and then tried LeBron James session. I completely just know the app is amazing and will become better in the future. The app just helps me stay calm. I can sometimes get mad easily or just say the wrong thing at the wrong time. I love this apps and you can just open your whole self up to this app. Totally recommend!
783,2020-06-26 00:02:55,1,"I deal with ADD, depression and Social anxiety. I was recommended meditation and I decided I’d try it. I first downloaded this app in 2017. And used it and loved it for a while until the app updated and now to do any sort of guided meditation longer than two days you have to pay the hefty price of 70 bucks a year. It irks me when apps like this are advertised to “Improve your mental health.” When in reality they are monetary traps meant to exploit and take advantage of those who are at a vulnerable point in their lives. More proof that mental illness is being commercialized and used as a means to reap profit. They should be ashamed. Offering up an app that’s supposed to help people who are desperate for help then turning around and paywalling them.
It’s a shame because this app had potential."
784,2019-09-24 19:47:57,5,How does this app calm me down so much when you think it is not going to work. Like I come home play a game than immediately start listening to the calming noises. It’s like magic. My dog falls asleep right away it so calming and reduces stress. I would listen to it all day if I had to. I definitely recommend you this app if you have had a long day at work and you just need a break it has music that works offline to if you were stressed at work. Try this app read this comment it will HELP stress a lot better than anything.
785,2019-09-17 12:42:43,5,"Love this app, they are constantly adding new things & it has helped me overcome insomnia by listening to sleep stories before I doze off. I love all the meditations & masterclasses. So much to choose from! One recommendation I would like to see is the option to delete sleep stories) because theres so many) or have the favorite option put them in a separate tab or at least show them as a favorite as you scroll them (not having to go into each one before seeing it marked as a favorite.) Thanks!"
786,2019-02-06 12:56:19,5,"I'm glad I start my days with Calm. It has begun to really impact my life in a positive way. I was excited to see Spanish content being added and just wanted to share some feedback from someone who is bilingual. It would be great if rather than selecting one language In your settings for the whole experience, that you would be able to choose to view the Spanish content in your library with the English content and filtered by language while using the English version of the app."
787,2019-06-08 05:21:55,2,"I did the initial free subscription and even though I love this app there was no warning when they withdrew the money from my account. They didn’t even ASK if I wanted to start paying for a subscription. I know this is typical business practice, but I find it sleazy and extremely shady. You should always at least send a notification about a free trail expirations before charging the client to see if they ACTUALLY WANT TO GET A FULL SUBSCRIPTION. what’s on the app is worth the money, but only if you can afford it. Now I’m screwed out of food money for a week because of the ghost charge. Because of this I will not be using this app anymore and have requested my refund for a service I never wanted to begin with."
788,2019-01-15 10:40:51,5,"I am not a big proponent of apps. I usually find the “free” version and make due, mainly because I’m so busy to utilize most apps to their potential and I feel like it’s a waste of money.  I have used this app EVERY SINGLE night since I downloaded it and when I wake up from a refreshed night or sleep, I look forward to coming back to bed again night after night. Calm has taken the anxiety out of bedtime, cognitive stress dreaming, and given me a peace I didn’t even realize I so desperately needed. 100% recommend this!"
789,2019-01-13 04:04:43,5,"I love Calm-legit can't stop raving about it to everyone I know. Small suggestion though- diversify the narrators. This app is the best app I've ever used hands down. It would be very nice to listen to narrators that aren't all white women. A bit more inclusion and diversity would be great. How about a grandma or grandpa reading a sleep story? Or a woman from India, or Senegal, or even New Orleans? I love Calm regardless, but I know this may help others to feel more comfortable - as a lot of people are already new to meditative and calming practices alike.
Thanks for making this amazing app"
790,2018-12-28 05:46:23,5,I have been using this app for meditation for over a year now. Not only us the guidance very helpful it is informative. There are many areas that can be explored because of the plethora of categories. So for those who decide to buy the full package the amount of content is worth the price in my eyes. My only criticisms are I wish there were more informative almost teaching kind of classes and that there could be longer daily calms. Overall a fantastic app that has helped me through a hard time!
791,2018-11-18 01:11:05,5,"I downloaded the calm app almost 2 years ago. Initially I was interested in the sleep stories and was surprised at how well they worked for me and how much of a deeper sleep I was getting. I started paying for the app and decided to explore the meditations. I had no expectations on what meditation could do for me and I can honestly say it has completely changed my life. I have experienced increase patience, forgiveness, and happiness while my anxieties and worries about life have depleted. I am so thankful to have found meditation through this app."
792,2018-08-23 15:33:09,5,I couldn’t fall asleep because my mind would not shut down then my adoring husband would snore and I became weak and sick then I came across this app at group class for managing stress and this app puts my mind to rest and with headphones on especially the over ear one for more comfort to me I sometimes fall asleep before the meditation is over in under 15 minutes! I feel a lot better and it is teaching me wonderful things with the master class too please check it out if you’re looking for peace especially at night.
793,2018-06-24 16:27:15,5,"I used headspace for a year, well maybe couple of times a week throughout my subscription: nothing against the app, but the long pauses caused me to be sleepy , I work 60-70 hours a week on an average. But when I downloaded this app, it changed everything. The narrator keeps me with her. Her narration keeps my focus on the guided meditation and it seems to be working. I have been able to give importance to my mental health more in my stressful work routine. Please give this app a shot with a 7 days free trial, and then decide for yourself. Happy meditating."
794,2018-03-20 14:35:55,5,"Good app for meditation. I am a paid subscriber and found it a bit better than Heapspace.  

It’s app, however, drains my new iPhones battery drastically. I have turned off background music as well to prevent it from draining the battery. Developers need to fix this as soon as possible. Also, they should provide an option in iPhone’s app specific settings to stop background activity (like other apps). One shouldn’t have to go through the forums to find how to turn off background activity/music."
795,2018-06-17 19:56:03,3,"Great quality sound and video clips and I'm amazed at how effective stories are at getting me to fall asleep. The developers have also taken care to add lots of good content. I cannot tell where audio files loop but I can for some of the video content, but it's more important they got the audio right than the video.

Only complaint I have about using the app is that I wish I could set one of the sleep sounds to come on after a sleep story. For some reason, even though I fall asleep while listening to a sleep story, I wake up when it stops. I then have to open the app,
 select a sleep sound e. g. waves and then resume my sleep. Should be possible to have a sleep sound come on when a story ends.

My biggest complaint about this is that the developers are a bit greedy. I could swallow the $ 60 price tag, but I can't share it with a family member. Not even a spouse? At this price, not being able to share it seems a bit greedy and destroys the goodwill generated from using the app."
796,2017-12-30 13:59:56,5,"The daily meditation is 10 minutes and time spent wisely. Calm has assisted me with finding peace, happiness and becoming less reactive. In 2018 I hope to use it daily. I find myself using calm more depending on my stress level or unhappiness. The bedtime stories are nice as well. Sometimes I listen to the nature background noise just to imagine I’m somewhere else. I prefer calm with headphones. This helps me to be completely engaged. I recommend this to all my friends and family that are overwhelmed with life (e.g. spouse, kids, work and other demands)..."
797,2017-08-26 13:35:21,5,"I never thought I could adopt a mindfulness practice until I stared using Calm; I initially began with the free version and then upgraded for the use of sleep stories and the daily Calm. I used to fall asleep with my TV on for background noise, but with the sleep stories I no longer do that and I find myself getting more restful sleep and falling asleep faster than I used to.
I love the image quote that come up free completing a meditation and the calendar is also very motivating in continuing to stick with and develop my practice further. Thank you Calm team!"
798,2021-01-08 05:56:35,5,"I’ve absolutely adored this app! I’ve had it for over a year. I first started using it for free, but quickly realized being a paying member would be worth it. If you use it daily, or even weekly, It’s honestly such a small price to pay and 100% worth the investment. I primarily utilize the sleep stories, and play rain at night.. but I’ve also dabbled in daily check ins, master classes, and meditation. This app has saved me from so many anxiety driven nights. I will forever be grateful to this platform. Thank you!!"
799,2020-11-17 02:44:58,4,I like this app and I love the new improvements. I love the mood and the reflection however it’s no longer sync with my Apple health and I can’t even see where to make sure it’s connected from the app.  Used to be easy. Per the Health app it’s connected but I wouldn’t be able to tell from the app itself. And the last time it recorded a session on health was October 2.  Not sure what they did in between. Also it should allow you the option to edit an entry for reflection. If you didn’t finish or wanted to add something after you close the app oh well.
800,2020-09-06 16:40:03,5,"I have used and like the meditations nd talke, but my favorite feature is the sleep stories. I love listening to them and they usually lead me to sleep. If not, they still are calming and engaging. The only issue I have with this app is after a while of using it, it keeps crashing, and you have to delete it and reload it.  It doesn’t save all your settings, but favorites are saved. I gave this four stars for its great content, but wish they could fix the problem with crashing."
801,2020-10-12 11:39:18,4,"I’ve been using Calm for a few years and it has totally changed my life. The guided meditations are amazing. This review is less for the service and more for this actual app. 

- Once you complete a program, there’s no way to start it over in the app, you now have to manually manage the series and your place in it. I often restart a series and I have to “heart” the last one I did in order to keep track OR I have to go through my history to try to find out which one I last did. 

- There’s no search. I have to remember which category a certain program I am looking for is in. 

I feel like I can’t be the only one that restarts programs but it just seems like it would be an easy fix for the service to indicate where I left off last better. 

With that being said, this app is worth every penny and I’m grateful to y’all for putting it together 🖤"
802,2019-07-31 03:03:25,5,"THIS IS AMAZING THE BEST RELAXING MEDITATION APP EVER!!!! It surprised me so much that it lets you relax and the pictures are AMAZING and relaxing and it’s like you are in the picture and it’s just amazing and relaxing! But one thing if you have a big family and you have nowhere to have your own privacy go outside in your backyard or somewhere quiet. Also, if you have siblings that are sometime bugging you or being annoying this is the app for you!!! I LOVE THIS APP SOOO MUCH!! It helps my siblings and mostly me all I do I go in my living room turn my tv off and go on the app just amazing!"
803,2020-06-02 19:58:55,4,"I think calm is a wonderful way to reduce my anxiety and help me sleep better. The one issue I’m having is that when I want a sleep story there is only two stories to listen to and I’m getting tired of listening to them over and over again. There should be more story’s and maybe consider the music to have 1 open. But overall it is an amazing app to help yourself CALM ( get it 😉) down. It can get a 5 star app if you just add a few more story’s that are not locked, and some music or calming sounds I can listen to!"
804,2020-06-02 00:11:03,1,"I wanted to like this app. But it’s customer service not CALMing at all. It’s also non-existent. I did the free trial and enjoyed the guided meditations, especially from Tamara. She’s good. But, I needed to wait to do the $70 sub and went to cancel it before the deadline. When I did so, it offered me the sub at $48 instead of $70. So, I agreed. Come to find out, it still charged me $70, which I would not have paid. When I went to look for support, the Calm site is just a circle of no way to contact anyone. They redirect you to Apple for any refunds. Well, Apple has no way to partial refund, so it was either keep the sub for $70 or get a full refund. I chose the latter. And that’s a shame because the app content is great. It’s just horribly managed outside of that. Thanks for nothing."
805,2020-04-16 11:05:10,2,"I’ve had this app for around a year now, and in the second half of this last year I noticed that the app slowly started getting, well, slower. It takes literally a solid 5-10 minutes just to load one session now, if it loads at all! It’s extremely frustrating to want to take time to relax and recoup my mind, yet I sit there anxiously waiting for it to start and just get more annoyed from the wait. Not to mention I’m often on a time crunch and having to wait SO long JUST to start a session is ridiculous, and many times lately I’ve had to forego the session. Wasted money paying for the full version and not being able to use it. :("
806,2019-10-16 10:50:16,4,"I mostly love this app but have been less delighted with the relatively recent change of the background sounds from rain softly falling to the cacophony of birdsong in a forest. What I’d like to see is an ability to choose from a selection of background sounds; say the aforementioned rain, waves on a beach, the wind through the trees of a forest and yes, for those who find it relaxing, the birds as a default. Also, after a sleep story ends, sometimes it fades to silence (my preference) but sometimes it switches back to those noisy birds, which negates any relaxation or sleep attained through the story. Fade to silence - always!"
807,2019-03-30 20:24:02,5,"I’ve had the premium membership for 2 years. Before Calm, I could not fall asleep easily, or go back to sleep. Calm and sleep stories changed all of that. I easily fall asleep before the end of any story. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I pick another story and I’m back asleep in less than 15 mins. Best news... it’s great if you are nervous about flying. Just listened to Tamara’s 21 days of calm, 5 sessions, during a flight today. It soothes my nerves and gave me the opportunity to really enjoy my flight. Thank you Calm!!!"
808,2019-04-24 16:29:51,3,"I do enjoy this app and find that it helps me fall asleep or wind down. My primary complaint is that for $60, the majority of every meditation is the same. Whether it’s calming flight anxiety or learning about sleep, only a few minutes of each meditation is different. For how much the app costs, I don’t understand why they can’t fold in more research tidbits. Or calming truths about the specific issue. 7.5 minutes out of 11 will all be the same with just a few differences at the end. The sleep stories and nature sounds are nice, so if you want to spend $60 on that you can. Or you can find the Zen Garden pandora station and fall asleep for free."
809,2018-12-10 11:23:13,5,"This app is organized so well. I love to do the daily meditations, but also love that there are topic specific meditations and timed meditations that are shorter. The masterclasses or a big bonus. They are very well done and thought-provoking. This app has become a part of my life and daily routine. I tried the Insight Timer meditation app after doing this app for some time and felt totally lost. There is no comparison between the two. I am not going to bother to try others because this one is truly working for me. I highly recommend Calm."
810,2018-11-30 02:35:57,5,"My therapist suggested this app to me. At first I was skeptical. Meditation seemed silly to me. But as I went through the app and tried it out, meditation and other exercises really helped relieve my anxiety and stress. There is many things offered on the app, such as a breathing exercises, meditation sessions for various things (happiness, anxiety, etc.), sleep stories, and so on. The app is mainly free. You can become a member and get more things on the app, but it isn’t necessary. I’ve been using the app for almost a year, I’m not a member, and it is still extremely helpful."
811,2018-10-26 19:02:17,5,"This is a lovely and helpful app, but be aware that you have very limited features without in-app purchases (it's like 8 dollars a month to unlock them or something - a bit steep, if you ask me). But the basics are pretty nice.

However it is in desperate need of a search function. It has categories but that isn’t always enough for me to find a particular meditation. It’s good there are a lot of options but it would be great to be able to search through them."
812,2018-03-28 06:44:59,5,"If we all just use this amazing app - the world will be a better place. But really, this app has the power to change you, to make you healthier, smarter, more successful. But it’s up to YOU to pick it up every day and use it. Don’t be judgmental to yourself if you miss a day or two, but make sure to show up, open this app and use it! Even just 10 minutes are enough. 

Thank you Calm team for bringing such an amazing app to this world and Tamara for your lovely, calm voice guiding us all :)"
813,2017-11-07 02:25:48,5,"I listen to sleep stories every night, and they have helped me go to sleep quicker as well as to sleep better through the night.  My theory is that it gives my mind something to focus on besides my random worries and thoughts.  Additionally, I am new to meditation and this app has helped me with recognizing tension and anxiety, and how to get back to the present and just focus on breathing.  It sounded so silly to me (and still does) but it really helps.  I plan to renew my subscription when it is time."
814,2021-01-28 17:25:08,5,"This app has been a tremendous help for my anxiety. I struggle with anxiety on an almost daily basis, along with semi-frequent panic attacks. I have been using the Calm app to meditate daily. There are several series on managing stress and anxiety. I started off with the free version and then quickly purchased the full version. My husband and I enjoy listening to the soundscapes at night as well. The price seems steep, but if you break it down to what it would be per month, it’s not bad at all. I couldn’t be happier with this app. Thank you, Calm!"
815,2020-07-18 05:44:46,5,"I love they added Harry Styles 
Love how you can do chew I in and then it shows you what story you can use to help with that so good u have the levels of stress and depression down I only have anxiety attacked once a week now instead of every night this has really help me with my depression and help me see a different side of life same with my stress
I like how you unlock the app with taking a deep breath to get in that feeling of that sort of mood 5/5 recommend
Ps: I have the premium or what ever and let me tell you soooooooo worth it
😙"
816,2020-06-07 16:55:53,5,"I just want to say I am so surprised to love this app.  I have really high BP since I was 46, and have been trying to help myself with meditating.  I just want to tell you guys I love Jeff!  He is so cool and non-dorky that I am shocked.  Tai non-authoritative like other meditation teachers who admonish is to “focus only on the breath” for example.  But no, Jeff introduces the concept of “homebase” where you can focus on anything you choose.  So I have chosen the tip of my nose for some reason lol..  Thank you Jeff for this wonderful series I hope you read this review."
817,2020-01-29 08:32:41,5,"I was dealing with sudden, unexpected loss and CALM played a significant role in my regaining my peace. Personally, the meditations were extremely helpful, especially at bedtime where sleep was a challenge. I also was suddenly dealing with high blood pressure, often the physical consequence of trauma. I focused on the daily meditations and self care and found my new path. This only works if you: 1) Believe; 2) Really want change; 3) Commit. I have not found a more useful, significant app that offers true support and healing. FANTASTIC! AMAZING! LIFE ALTERING!"
818,2020-01-01 19:20:47,5,"I am a calm convert. I was hesitant about trying this app, particularly about taking the extra step of paying if I liked the free version, but I couldn’t help but love it. It took me a long while, but after listening to Stephen Fry lull me to sleep every night for a month with his free sleep story, I was hooked. I purchased the app. Just for the sleep stories, this app is worth it. The very fact that I get meditation, music, etc. in addition to my beloved sleep stories is icing on the cake. And I’m using it all!!! Do yourself a favor, try it, buy it."
819,2019-12-27 13:29:26,5,This is the first and so far only time I have ever paid for an app!  A few years ago I was suffering some severe insomnia and night time panic attacks.  I started with the free version and that worked so well I upgraded.  I have been doing so well I kind of forgot about the app.   Been struggling lately and find myself right back here.   Mediation is hard for me because I have such a hard time shutting down my brain.  This app actually works for me- and those times I can’t shut down I can just restart the meditation.
820,2019-11-27 15:15:46,5,We have been using the calm app for just about a year now and it was worth every penny. It provides something for the whole family. My kids love listening to a sleep story for bed and when they do they are out in minutes. Calm has a very wide verity of things to use including meditation session which are one of my favorites. Another thing I love about the clam app is that there is many things you can personalize to get you the best results. I very much suggest this app to anybody who is looking for a meditation mindset.
821,2019-10-22 13:56:09,5,"Great app. There are a plethora of meditation course options which are all very similar in nature, with minor variations. I wish there were more options for narrators especially in the daily calm section - it gets a little repetitive hearing the same voice every day. 

There are also other options like bedtime stories, music, a yoga course or two. Really great variety. Well worth the $30/year subscription. It’s paid me back in troves. I recommend it to all my friends who are looking to get into meditation."
822,2019-08-13 15:46:22,5,"I started using this app about a year ago to start a regular home meditation practice. I had a bad injury and was unable to go to yoga and meditation classes and wanted to continue my practice on my own. It’s helped me to be consistent in my daily practice, track my progress, learn different techniques, and it has even inspired me to teach meditation. I love this app soo much, what it stands for, and how they’re constantly adding new content (including a mindfulness program for kids!) I recommend it to everyone I know!"
823,2019-02-01 23:03:09,5,"This app would be so much better if the other narrators also voiced some of the meditations instead of just the sleeptime stories. Being stuck with a voice I can’t stand is no fun. The potential of the app is pretty great, its just not going to get there until users have better voice selection and control. That said, others may not find her voice as annoying as I do. Search for and listen to Tamara Levitt before purchasing to see if you like her voice or not. I wish I had."
824,2019-04-18 15:15:00,4,"This app has been such a gift to my life! I was feeling “off” and spiritually depleted for quite some time (over a year). I knew I needed something, then stumbled on an article about guided mindful meditation and apps. I looked at a few apps, but was drawn to this app because of its ease of use, rich features, and seemingly endless content. Since starting with the app, I feel more at peace, centered, and like my old self. The daily mediations and featured meditations give me real and immediate tools I can use to quickly draw myself back to a place of peace when thoughts/experiences attempt to off-center me."
825,2018-09-10 00:37:29,5,"I can’t accurately describe Calm with any words other than:  This app truly is a life saver in so many ways. I use it for anxiety, anger and couple it with my ongoing growth from therapy for emotional traumas of my past.  Tamara’s voice is so perfect for the guided meditations. And the musical selections from the Scenes section can instantly put me in a place of warmth and happiness.  
The free stuff in the app is great, but the yearly subscription is way worth it if you’re serious about finding a new and better place for your mind...even if you don’t use it every day."
826,2018-12-23 16:14:12,1,"I spent many years training in a Zen monastery and after testing this app in comparison to others on the market, I have concluded that Andy (from Headspace) is the real deal. Andy trained in a monastery as well and you can tell his heart is into the experience behind his app. This app was developed by a woman who was lost and looking for a way to make money from her mindfulness experiences. So as a business model, Calm seems to driven by other motives than purely service to others - charging big dollars for mindfulness spas and future resorts. It’s also interesting to note that the theme of their releases seem to coincide “coincidently” with Headspace’s releases. Of course, who knows who is copying whom. But have an experience for yourself in the trial versions of both. You’ll see for yourself..."
827,2018-03-29 16:22:18,5,"I subscribed to Calm for everyone in my family 3 months ago and it has had a tremendous impact. My youngest sons (9y & 10y) have a 5 minute session every morning when they wake up. My oldest 2 (boy 13y, girl 14y) do it several times a week. We all do 1 15 minute session together on Sundays. When my youngest’s behavior gets out of control, we (positively) encourage him to “reset his emotional state” by having a calm session (instead of punishment). This technique has given him awareness of his emotional state and helps to improve his behavior every time."
828,2020-09-16 16:26:50,5,"I’m using Calm today whilst in the terrible California fire season. I listened (and am listening as I write this) to the background “scene” I chose of gentle rain falling on leaves, and over that the excellent session with Tamara Levitt on Procrastination, an avoidance behavior that has for years undermined my aspirations. I feel both soothed and motivated! Yesterday I listened to a hypnotic description of the Bodelian library. I have also listened to the beautiful deep voice of LeBron James describing his approach to success, and felt motivated and uplifted. Calm is an excellent resource for surviving this crazy 2020."
829,2017-11-22 15:38:49,2,"I tried both this app and Headspace for 30 days each. I would say that, by far, Headspace is the vastly superior meditation app. Headspace actually focuses on learning how to meditate and guides you through solid foundations of meditation. Meanwhile, this Calm app has a woman who just talks and rambles nonstop throughout most of the meditations about whatever the topic of the day is. It's not meditation if someone is rambling the whole time and forcing your brain to think. And then, during the VERY FEW TIMES when actual guidance is being given, it isn't even helpful guidance. Plus, the guidance varies wildly every single day, so we can't even build up a solid practice of meditation that builds up upon the same daily rituals."
830,2020-10-26 13:02:18,3,"I like the soundscapes they have. I love the features where it’s your background. 

However, a good portion of the material uses the same narrator. It’s stressful because I don’t like the her voice. 😅 I think that’s important to me because the previous app I paid for had unlimited narrators and meditations. I need the variety because I already struggle with guided meditation. And I need them occasionally because  I get anxiety attacks. 

If it wasn’t for my medical provider offering it to me, I would not purchase.  But the content seems great if you can stand Tamara narrating most of the content."
831,2019-10-17 15:24:28,5,"When I first got there calm app I had no idea that my partner of 30 years, who has never been a meditator, would begin joining me each day for a meditation before we got out of bed and started our day. What a gift to us both—individually and as a couple! 

I run my own business, Women’s aha! Camp, and I often share the daily quotes with past campers in our private fb group or with the world on my fb page.

So much goodness comes to my life and the lives of those I touch. Thank you!"
832,2020-06-29 21:19:44,2,"I do like this app but the main problem is that you can’t access 75% of the sounds/stories without paying for them. There’s a total of 4 sleep stories available in the entire list that is unlocked without paying. Two of which I don’t use since the narrators voice is not soothing to me. I literally switch between two sleep stories at night which seems a little ridiculous but it still has been helping me fall asleep much faster. I don’t use it for meditation yet so I can’t say much for that, I only use it for sleep. I would even be okay if some of the sleep sounds would be unlocked ie rain/ocean ect but nope. Gotta pay for those too."
833,2019-05-11 12:27:07,5,"I love this app. I used to have sleep pillow but it wasn’t doing me much good so I downloaded this sleep app. Turns out that this app also really helps anxiety stress and happiness. What I love about it is that it can tell stories to you and actually meditate WITH you. I love how it will narrate and talk with you. I really do love this app and recommend it for you. There is only one thing I would change about this app, you have to have premium to get everything witch bums me out but I don’t have premium and I still love this app."
834,2019-04-04 04:48:30,5,"I would love to see the scenery in full size on my phone like I used to without your trying to get me to enroll in other apps that cost money that I can’t afford. I was actually going to text my daughter to download this app to help her through some hard times she’s enduring now, but with my frustration tonight, I’m not sure I will. I merely wanted to see mountains, the lake and snow as I’m homesick for them but the ads made me frustrated and disappointed because I’ve told everyone I know how wonderful this app has been.🙁"
835,2018-09-27 01:52:28,5,"It took me several months to bite the bullet and just purchase this app. I am now kicking myself wondering what I went all those months without it. I did the 7 day free trial and after the first session of Day 1, I felt so much personal value and growth from this that I immediately knew I was going to purchase the full version of this app and that I would gladly pay double what they are charging for it. It’s billed up front but it works out to only $5 per month if you break it down that way. WELL WORTH IT."
836,2019-03-02 00:43:59,4,"Thank you developers of Calm!🙏🏼 I’ve felt heard. I appreciate the implementation of guest passes! I’ve shared this with my family & people close to me. 
I would also greatly appreciate the idea of building a social tab within the app, I suggest calling it “Calm Sangha/Community”. 
Something simple to only encourage others to continue with their awareness practices like the “Activity” app, maybe something to help others share their realizations from their practice or just daily life struggles. 
Bring Dharma sharing to the internet🙏🏼🧘🏼‍♂️🧘‍♀️♥️🕊 May you be safe, may you be ever calm."
837,2018-10-09 07:31:25,1,"This isn’t a good app. They say it’s free but only like 1 story is free that you can’t even choose! Not to mention that the free stories are something like blue and gold and lavender fields? This is a scam. Don’t say it’s free, then have me enter the app for “Hundreds of calming stories for free” like you didn’t finish saying “after you pay $60 a year!” Wow now i can really take a deep breath upon entering the app. (sarcasm) Don’t forget you can do 7 or 21 days of happiness and stress relieving (and so on) Oh but the ones that are actually unlocked only really unlock one day of it. Like don’t you think that ruins the point of it? Because all of the 7-21 days link together to “relieve and calm you” This app is horible false advertisement. What a bunch of frauds for playing innocent people."
838,2018-05-28 03:11:05,5,The Calm App has helped me with my Panic Disorder Greatly. Every morning I wake up and I start my day with a session. Not only myself but my family can tell a difference in the way I act and the way I handle situations that arise. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for help with Anxiety. I Started with the trial and completed the first 7 days of Calm. On the 8th day I started the 21 Days of Mindfulness. On the 10th day of using the application I purchased the yearly subscription. It's the start on the right foot for my day to begin everyday. Thank You Calm App!!
839,2018-05-16 11:45:51,1,"This app has calming sounds. I wish it had voice options so each person can choose which is comfortable for them. Not worth the $75. So I cancel 2 day’s prior via email as the app stated and received a confirmation email back. I was still charged the annual fee of $ 75 when the 7 day’s ended. When I emails Calm again, which made me not so calm, they stated I should have canceled it they PayPal also( I should of ) I thought canceling with them is enough. They emailed me that iTunes has a high security system & I would have to work on that myself. They gave me links of course but still working on the refund during my free time of owning a business, having 3 kids, husband and a house hold to run."
840,2017-09-04 11:15:21,5,"I have tried to meditate numerous times over the years and have always struggled sticking with it. This app has given me such a gift. I look forward to my time every morning. 

Most meditations are 10-15 minutes long. So I just wake up 20 minutes earlier than before and start my day. I have been doing this for over a month and I am much more relaxed and productive at work. I teach art to 580 students a week K-8. My job is very hectic and this app is helping me be a much better teacher. 

Thank you Calm team!!"
841,2020-09-29 11:27:43,5,"Going through peri menopause has me experiencing many emotions which isn’t connected to any specific stressors of life. The only thing I can attribute this stress to are the hormones which are a little unbalanced at this time in my life. The Calm app keeps my mind relaxed, it gives me a break from thinking or over thinking things and during the times that my body is tight and stressed from head to toe the Calm app is there to remind my mind how to  ”breathe” and “take a mind break”. I highly recommend it!"
842,2021-02-12 10:16:51,4,"I really am loving this app, I use it every day for a.m. meditation and music to keep me less stressed during the workday. I love that they keep adding new music. My one annoyance, and the reason I only gave four stars, is because they only allow you to choose a female voice for most of the meditations. In my personal experience, I find I do better with a male voice, and I wish they give that option more often. Some of the meditations allow you to choose between a male and a female voice, and I think all of the meditations should do that."
843,2020-11-02 11:03:19,3,"I really love this App. It has helped me learn how to meditate and I can see how meditation helps me. I look forward to meditating every day. I would give this app 5 stars except for Tamara Levitt, her voice is on almost every guided meditation and there are no other options or very few options. For someone who is supposed to be guiding people though a meditation, she talks a lot. Just when I am getting into the meditation, she interrupts repeatedly. It is very frustrating and I have stopped my practice before the program is finished because of this. I will probably not renew my subscription when it comes due if this continues."
844,2020-09-12 19:37:20,5,"This app really changed my life. I’m prone to panic attacks and listening to this app is the only thing I’ve found to really get them under control so I don’t live in fear. Highly recommended for anyone struggling with panic and anxiety! And the background scenes and sleep stories are so soothing to listen to at night. Only one silly complaint: Tamara, please, PLEASE stop saying “wiggle your fingers and toes” at the end of your meditations. Something about it is so irksome. I can’t be the only one who’s bothered by it! 😂 But other than that, AMAZING!"
845,2020-07-22 02:36:18,5,"I absolutely love this app!  I originally didn’t pay for the upgrade and listened to the same sleep story every night for about 2 months. Then I realized how much the Calm app was helping me sleep. Now I don’t go to bed without it!!  I love being an adult who falls asleep to someone reading to me!!  It’s fantastic!!!  The only thing I wish it had was a thing (a star or check mark) telling me I’ve listened to a story already. Otherwise, I have absolutely nothing bad to say. I can’t remember sleep so good before the app. Thank you Calm!!"
846,2019-05-29 07:19:13,5,"I, first off, want to say that I’m 17 and I use this app almost every night. It works so well and puts me to sleep within 5 minutes of the story. But, my only complaint is that there is only 1 sleep story that’s free and listening about lavender every night gets kind of annoying. The premium subscription costs $70 per year and as a 17 year old, I don’t have enough money to pay for that myself and my parents don’t either. So, editors, please please add more free sleep stories. 

Sincerely,
Someone who probably has insomnia"
847,2019-04-26 21:11:36,5,"I have been meditating and practicing mindfulness off and on for several years now. I have used Headspace and love it and still have it but found I needed a change of pace. 
Calm is just that - it brings a sense of peace to my busy unfocused mind and I have been enjoying the 7 day free trial and plan to keep and continue after. The programs available offer the kind of guidance and reflection I have been wanting. The woman who narrates has a very nice, soft and relaxing voice. Highly recommend doing the trial to test it out."
848,2019-05-06 23:47:32,1,"The app itself is fine. The problem is when you download it thinking it’s free it’s actually not. I got a $90 something charge on my card and after embarrassing myself by calling my bank and reporting fraud I found out it was actually this app. I never thought I had selected such an expensive option for the app, and there are other cheaper options so I am not sure how the most expensive one is the default. I think it’s only fair that the app warn you that your free trial is ending and your about to be charged. Honestly very scammy of them to just have the most expensive option as the default and there is no warning you’re about to be charged. I am not the only person this happened to either."
849,2018-11-18 15:32:11,5,I have been diagnosed with pfd and IC and just got this app to help me relax my too tight pelvic floor and decrease my pelvic pain. It is starting to work as I have a lot of stress in my life. I am starting to feel a little better thank God. My pelvic pain was so bad I could hardly walk at times. I am planning on continuing doing this app for me for the rest of my life.I do too much for everyone else in my life and not enough for me. I want to get better and be able to live my life 100% with my husband once again.
850,2019-01-29 16:10:22,3,"No problem. I can deal with the free thing. But, I wonder why should I not be able to listen to, let's say, 5-6 tracks that are going to be free forever, and I have to pay for them? I mean, I got them free, yay, but as I entered the app the second time, I couldn't help but notice that, although I downloaded them, the tracks were blocked because I needed to pay a monthly subscription. This is mind- boggling to me. All the apps that rely on meditation have the exact same thing. You can stay free as long as tou have very little content. Open up more, it's a great app, maybe some don't pay so they see if they like it!"
851,2018-11-16 01:16:44,5,"Amazing isn't descriptive enough to give the Calm app it's rightful due. It has so many features on the paid version, I'm kicking myself for having waited to buy it. From meditation to sleep, stories to calming anxiety, this truly has it all. It has helped me in ways that I could not even have imagined in the beginning. The only changes I would make is being able to see my scenic screen in its entirety, not having my ""Daily Calm,"" and or new slew story taking up half the screen. Other than that, I love it!"
852,2018-11-10 00:10:08,5,"I love this app so much! I’m a student and Calm has really helped me find peace and happiness. I really would like to continue to meditate with this app, but I find that the yearly fee is very expensive. I would definitely spend money on this app if each session cost about $2 each. I feel like I would consider buying the full subscription more if I could continue to try out the session. Please consider this. Even if you can pay for sessions individually for one or two programs. Please 
❤️ too much $ for me"
853,2018-02-28 02:17:30,5,"I had been trying to meditate by myself but I found it was hard for me to concentrate. With this app I can concentrate completely and has helped me with my anxiety problems sooo much!!! The guidance is amazing I am totally addicted to this. Would recommend 100%. About the price... all money invested in health is money well spent. This is not a nice pair of shoes you can show off to your friends (it costs about the same) this app is for your soul, and health, you will be showing off your happiness, your mental health to everybody with the help of this app. LOVE IT"
854,2017-09-19 17:34:12,5,"This app was ""prescribed"" to me with my discharge papers after a long g hospital stay and it has been with me for the last 6 months. It has many meditation options to choose from and her voice is very reassuring. I particularly enjoy the sleep stories. I know a sleep story is good when I have to listen to it several times before getting the end. To me it means the story is doing its job - helping me fall asleep. It has never crashed and it doesn't take much storage. It's a must have during chaotic times."
855,2017-11-17 17:00:46,1,I got this app around last week and when I got it I didn’t really get on it that much yet. And So today I found out that $65 dollars was charged to my account and I had to look into it to figure out what was charging me that when I didn’t buy anything. I went through my settings and found that this app had charged me almost $70 and I didn’t do anything on there that gave them permission to purchase anything or even look at the option of buying something. I would really like to know how they managed to get that money on my account and I am not going to be getting this app back. Thankfully I got the money back but this is seriously concerning because there is nothing I did to allow this app to do this.
856,2020-12-01 21:01:54,5,"I have yet to find a similar app that resonates with me as much as this one. I use it everyday. As someone with GAD and Bipolar 2, it helps to have an app like this...

PROS: setup reminder notifications, ever-changing daily meditations, learning opportunities, soothing music, daily check-ins, a couple nice sleep stories (the Harry Styles one is ridiculously affective).

CONS: High cost (I think it’s worth it but money is tight and I almost didn’t get the app), mostly just 1 voice/meditation guide to listen to (I like Tamara, but I do wish I could hear other voices and different meditation styles), few sleep stories to choose from.

I would also suggest expanding upon the capacity of the calendar. The calendar only remembers 1 check in per day. Sometimes I do multiple check-ins per day, but the calendar doesn’t reflect that. 

All in all, I LOVE this app and highly recommend it. Thank you!!!"
857,2020-11-20 03:33:53,5,"Calm has helped me find sleep when I was so stressed out. I have had relationship trouble throughout this Covid crisis and that transferred to troubles at work. I am having financial hardship right now and cannot afford the Calm App , but I listen to as much as I can and I listen to them again and again. Calm has also helped me with anxiety and leads me to a place of quietness inside. It reminds me that I have more control over worry, stress, anxiety, and anger. It brings me an awareness and makes me happy. Thanks. 
My birthday is Nov. 21 🤠"
858,2020-03-03 06:49:52,5,"This was an amazing story in which is really helping me fall asleep. I really like the way that she told the story of raggedy Ann. You were amazing and I hope to see more of your stories. By the way, are you an author, or are you just really good at telling stories? I think you really calmed me down and put the calm in this calm app. You made it more than just an app, and more like a journey through a place I have never been before. 🙂 also, do you tell stories a lot? Thank you for telling me this amazing story, and goodnight!!💤🌙"
859,2020-06-10 14:17:23,4,"I and my kids have really come to love this app over the past year of use. My only complaint is that there is no “play all” function for some of the music play lists. For example, the songs in the new Disney play list are on the short side in length. It’s really annoying that I have to unlock my phone and hit play for each song to the point that I often don’t bother listening to them. It would be nice if I could hit play once and it would run through the whole list of songs in a particular play list."
860,2020-03-02 23:34:07,5,"My first review of this app was filled with praise for its well-designed interface and content. That still rings true! Total
You’ll be impressed from the start! The bigger, more important, picture is how transformative the content of the app can be for your life and for the lives around you! Not only do I benefit greatly from the mediations, music selections, and master classes, but the students benefit from having a teacher with a more mindful outlook on life.  I cannot thank you enough for this experience!"
861,2020-02-07 13:38:05,5,"I received a calm subscription as a school initiative, and have definitely taken advantage of all things Calm! I have now been practicing for about 6 months and have noticed myself being able to identify emotions as they arise, sleep better/earlier, and a sense of inner peace when I practice more than once a day. 
The app also has a great way to track your progress, see streaks, and check in with yourself each time you practice to notice any changes. 
I really enjoy this app!"
862,2019-10-13 07:55:21,5,"I normally don’t write reviews but I have thought this one deserves it. I was apprehensive about the subscription cost but once I tried it I wanted the full access immediately. 

I was on a bunch of meds at the time for sleep and anxiety and with the daily practices I was able to come off sleep meds all together. It was amazing to see how fast I was able to learn how to relax again and sleep. 

Go ahead and download it, your probably curious from seeing the ads everywhere anyway."
863,2019-01-30 16:19:00,5,"I think just about every person that lives working lifestyles needs a space of their own and this is an app that helps on me time while stopping everything else. I have had times were I used this in traffic rush hour, huge lines shopping, Financial struggles, relationships during filing out paper work, etc! I can’t see enough good things about this calm apps! Breathing is an important thing in our life’s and this app helps to reintroduce it! It even has mindfulness sessions, sleeping stories, anxiety to!"
864,2019-07-04 14:11:36,2,"I was really excited to start Calm. I tried the free book and it was great! I fell asleep so well. I can't believe how well it worked.
   
   Me...I stupidly didn’t see there was a trial. I know that 70$ a year...but for most people that is way to much money. It is an AMAZING DEAL for one year. However, it is too much money for me and I can’t afford it. Even though the book was amazing...it wasn’t worth a trial/subscription. I also can’t do this because my family can’t put down 70$ in a week. 

        I found this app on a commercial and I thought this would be a great app for me because I have so much stress and anxiety and I am almost never positive. This is a big bummer for me because I need it.

      I asked my parents for extra allowance. They said no. Especially cause my mom just lost her job I can't pay at least 70$ in one week. After you are finished in a week, you must pay for the subscription. 

     I really wish I could do this app, but I can't and that makes me upset.

     Either lose the subscription or downsize it to 10$-20$."
865,2017-10-06 16:09:39,5,"I had tried a few different meditation apps. One of my friends suggested Calm. I have been wanting to strengthen my focus and concentration for school and daily life. I was having some bouts of anxiety that I had never experienced before.  Since I've been using Calm, I've been able to organize my thoughts and feelings, and managing anxiety in a productive way. There is a focus for specific weaknesses; anxiety, the need to focus, or a daily meditation. My goal is to use Calm every day. I feel better when I do."
866,2018-03-24 13:34:01,1,"O stars

I heard about this app on a morning news program, read the great reviews so I downloaded it. Then I read the privacy policy and said no thanks.
In order to use all the features of this app you have have to agree to allow cookies not only from the app developer but from third parties too. I don’t allow cookies so this was the first deal breaker.

The second deal breaker is all the personal data they collect including 2 items that I can see no reason for them to collect. The first is your location. No reason for them to know that. The 2nd item is even creepier - They collect the name of the web page you visited before you accessed their services!!! Absolutely no reason for them to know this (this is listed under the section called “Information Related to use of the Services” for anyone who wants to see this and all the other info they collect.)

With the recent problems multiple websites have had with people’s personal info being collected by 3rd parties I no longer trust anyone to keep my data safe so this app is deleted from my phone."
867,2020-07-19 23:03:33,5,"This is a helpful tool for the day-to-day challenges of life. It brings awareness to the importance of applying mindfulness to all we do, however mundane it may appear to be at that moment. It raises consciousness and makes living be intentional. Every aspect of our life on Earth becomes equally precious by eliminating the boring and the unimportant. 
I find myself no longer trying to avoid what I used to view as uncomfortable or even wasteful. Everything and everyone has a purpose and it’s up to the individual to acknowledge that."
868,2020-06-06 02:18:15,5,"I was never a kind of person who can meditate , at least thats what I thought. Realizing my mind wanders pretty easily I wanted to act on it and when I read online I found meditation is best way to control your mind. Searching for sources to learn how to Meditate I felt that something like an app that can help me to start meditating and here I am now. I recommend this app. I started 30 day meditation course and I am hoping to achieve better results."
869,2020-05-13 01:21:27,5,"I own a sleep number bed and had been getting horrible numbers at night when I slept. I started using this app and my sleep has improved by over 15 numbers per night. I have less tossing, less getting up, and less stress. I listen to music at least 30 min before sleep to help relax. One thing I like the most so far, is that it keeps playing all night until I turn it off. Very happy with it. I purchased the yearly program. You won’t be disappointed."
870,2020-04-23 14:57:55,5,"I absolutely am obsessed with this app. OBSESSED. I have ADHD, high anxiety and insomnia. The story “Wonder” told by Matthew McConaughey is a GAME CHANGER! I was blown away and could of sworn he hypnotized me or something because I have never been able to ever fall asleep as fast and as sound as I did. I listen to it every single night. I couldn’t tell you what the story is really about or the end of it because I am OUT by at least half way through. I love this app so much and I am very pleased with the purchase and even the cost. Love love love love love!!!!!"
871,2020-01-01 13:33:45,5,I have had uncontrollable epilepsy for the last 6 years after being seizure free for 30. A friend recommended that I try the Calm app and I have physical proof that it works; at least for me. A recent weeklong study of my seizures was really causing me a lot of stress. The doctor asked me if I could calm down. I closed my eyes and took three deep breaths and then followed my breath. The doctor was shocked! My read out completely changed to a steady calm rhythm. It became my “trick” that I had to repeat when anyone came into my room!
872,2020-04-21 13:17:45,1,"I was excited when I saw this app on the Today Show as I suffer from anxiety and sleep problems and was very very disappointed that the free version basically offers nothing. Please know this before you download. You don’t have access to the sleep stories except maybe two. You don’t have access to meditations other than the beginning to a series. You don’t have access to the relaxing sounds. You’re not even able to open your daily meditation. This app could be a powerful tool to those that need it, but not everyone that needs this app has the money to pay for it and I don’t think it’s fair to advertise this app to people who can not afford the care."
873,2019-11-28 01:33:53,5,"Hello human brethren! Because I’m definitely not an alien that came from mars. Ever since coming to this Kanye, I have been thinking about how I can take over the world and doing experiments and things like that... that puts A LOT of strain on my body. This app helps me to remember to be grateful and to breath (I have a hard time remembering sometimes). So this helps. The second thing is that the colors are calming and very soothing to my foreign eye... it helps a lot with calming me down. So in the end this app helps my body and my mind. GET THIS APP!!! 

-Invader Zimm"
874,2019-10-15 23:25:06,5,"This app is excellent for beginners. It helps me feel like I CAN meditate, when before I used to get frustrated with not doing it “right.” I love the series on specific issues like sleep problems and managing anxiety. I also love the bedtime meditations and stories. Quality programs cost money, but this one was a SO worth the price. Plus, having paid for it gives me extra motivation to stay on track and use it often so I get my money’s worth. This is the second year I bought it. I love it!"
875,2019-09-21 15:05:59,5,"Fantastic app!!  

I began using this app in the classroom to allow the students some time to calm themselves and refocus their energy.  The students often tell me it is their favorite part of the day.   We also use the music throughout the day while students are working independently.   

I began using it at home as well.  I do the daily meditations as well as the bedtime stories to help me shut down my brain ...I sleep a lot better and am able to manage stress a bit more effectively."
876,2019-07-11 00:01:34,5,"This app was recommended by my psychologist after I experienced high anxiety following some traumatic events and high stress at work. I am not sure what guided me that very day to do it, but it is an essential component to getting better. Tamara is my favorite. And Dr. Chatterjee is so knowledgeable and his views are based on logic and common sense. It is a part of my new daily routine, and I recommend it most highly. It is at my fingertips at any time I need it. More companies should offer & encourage this as an integral part of a wellness program."
877,2019-02-09 06:21:52,5,"I love calm but would like for there to be an option to create a playlist. I like listening to the daily calm but then need to reopen my phone to set up a new meditation or sleep story or music. For me, having the ability to continue focusing on meditation without having to restart the app would be amazing. I am giving the app 3 stars so that my voice will be heard.  I am very happy with the app. But this improvement could set this app apart from other awesome apps such as aura."
878,2019-06-13 05:15:11,2,"So I downloaded calm a year ago and absolutely fell in love. I would use a story time every night and loved the streak to hold myself accountable. I stopped using the app for a month or two. I am completely devastated. While originally there were only 5 or 6 sleep stories, now there are two (one that is targeted for younger children). The meditations have been cut down by an extreme amount. I feel guilty because I’ve been recommending this app to people like crazy and they came back asking why I would recommend something with such a high membership fee. I just wish it still allowed a healthy place for those who can’t afford to pay such high prices for an app"
879,2019-02-28 07:04:57,2,"I had this phone on my previous phone (iPhone 7) and it had way more free features than when I downloaded it tonight for my new phone. Now you might think that I just haven’t used it in a while, but that is not the case. I just used it on my old phone yesterday. In fact when I pull it up on my old phone all the free features I love are still there. So why are they not on this phone? I mostly use this for the soundscapes and baby shh music as well as the free moshi stories. I would have given this 5 stars but the inconsistency with the same account on two different devices is annoying and feels like a ploy to get me to spend $70 for premium"
880,2019-01-12 21:47:17,5,I am enjoying this app so much. It really helps me focus on the breath and not on things which cause anxiety and stress. I also love the sleep stories. Works so well that I have never heard the end of a story. I had rated it 4.5 because I was struggling with the cost and whether or not to pay for the full version. Since then I have decided that the benefits were worth the cost and paying the one time fee helped me not dwell on the cost every month. I have recommended it to many friends.
881,2018-11-14 12:16:18,5,"I’ve been using this app for the past month and a half on an off but consistently the past three days (Meditation course on Self Esteem). It’s practical, the sound tracks are varied and keep with my mood, the knowledge and practical exercises extremely helpful, skilled neutral tone, inclusive narration. 

The bed time stories engaging; tap into the imagination and are soothing at the same time (have helped me find much needed sleep). Best of the apps  I’ve used (insight timer, headspace). I’ve tried them all! (Or almost all ;-) )"
882,2017-12-08 14:27:01,5,"This app receives 3 stars ONLY because I am still getting use to the functions. I was disappointed that there is a charge for a premium version, however, the standard does just fine. There is ONE, small but mighty, adjustment I would recommend. . . Utilizing the app while in other screens. I can see how this would be counter intuitive, but for me as a multitasker, this will aid in my use of the app. Other than that, so far so good! UPDATE : I spoke too soon, there is an outside of app function. . . 5 stars it is !!"
883,2017-10-25 01:12:52,5,"I was diagnosed with anxiety and I have a lot of stress. I was trying to study for geometry today and just noticed my mind blank out, my head started to hurt. Which was probably the effect of stress. I’m in 9th grade and I have so much stress, I didn’t even notice I was meditating for 15 minutes. It calmed me down, I did the 7 days of stress. I don’t usually write reviews but today I felt the need to. This app offers you free meditations because as a high schooler I cannot purchase any of them but the free ones are good enough."
884,2017-09-09 06:14:38,5,"I have been using this app since early spring. It's a wonderful practice. It helps to turn off the mental chatter that goes on, at the very least, it makes you aware of it. This way, you don't miss your life! I've been using the Daily Calm, but have tried some of the others.  I have enjoyed all that I have listened to. The price is very reasonable. Oh yes, the sleep stories are great, my favorites are the John Muir notes about the national parks. The truth is that I have rarely heard the whole story. I fall asleep! Calm is habit forming, a good habit!"
885,2017-08-26 14:14:05,5,"I rated this app in June/July and said I liked it.  I have upgraded my like to love.  It is so handy.  If I'm in a long line at the grocery store, and everyone else is freaking out about how long it is taking.  I pull out my phone and take a controlled mindfulness relaxation break. 
I leave the store more relaxed and in a much better mood than the people I'm in line with.  Two(2) thumbs up!

Middle of the afternoon, a hectic day, I know I can get away from it all for a few minutes and get some sanity back in my life."
886,2021-03-02 04:26:17,5,"I LOVE this app. I look forward to listening to my stories in bed, most of the time I don’t even realize I fell asleep until morning and I see the app is up on my screen when my alarm goes off. Worth every penny. My ONLY complaint would be even more new stories more frequently, but I also use this app almost every night so I’ve listened to all of them.  I have my favorites and usually end up going back to those repeatedly and Nathalie Emmanuel is THE BEST, please do more stories."
887,2021-01-26 12:40:46,5,"I love this app so much! It’s great if you want to go to sleep easily, or meditate. Honestly u could pellet even do yoga to this if you wanted. Just last night I guess I fell asleep listen to “island of dreams” without realizing it! 😆 btw, if u do get this app, listen to island of dreams. Anyways though, this is an amazing app. It’s easy to operate and also super great if you have kids and your too tired to read them a bedtime story or something. I love this app so much, definitely recommend. Very relaxing and calm to use as well."
888,2021-01-23 04:24:35,5,"This is definitely the best app on the market and even with the free version it is extremely helpful. I have recommended this app to all of my friends and family as well as Facebook groups I’m in to help people who struggle with mental health or just struggling with stress. I used this app to help me navigate my emotions and heal through my divorce. I went from struggling with depression to being able to let go and heal through medication.
I love that you have options of who you prefer to speak on a lot of the medications.
I prefer the female voices myself.

The app is so easy to navigate through and has different categories for what you need. I love the sleep category and use this for my kids as well!
I’ve used this app for them since they were 18 months and 3 years old. 

I struggled with sleep before this app.., now I’m able to find inner pease."
889,2020-11-18 23:43:24,5,"I may have missed something.  Here at home it has been an exquisitely beautiful day.  Cool in the morning and perfect in the afternoon.  I spend most of the day outdoors.  Walking my sweet dog (so he will have a good night’s sleep) and so will the rest of us. Pulling weeds from the flower beds. Watching as the crew at our local college put up the Little Barn with the Baby Jesus in the manger.  Mary ,Joseph and the little animals looking on in awe.  Our neighbors have already begun to decorate for Christmas and why not?  I think I will too. How about you?"
890,2020-12-16 13:59:39,4,"Loving this in all its layers from music to checkins to meditations and beyond. I have used the app for a couple of months now and as I grow my mindfulness practice, I’d like this to grow with me, so-to-speak. For example, my daily checkins have 12 options to describe my emotions. It seemed like a fair amount until I started to really go deeper and pinpoint feelings not represented. Are frustrated and angry truly the same? No, hardly. So just a thought as this app has been a blessing in so many ways and I know I’ll keep using it. Consider this though when making updates! Thanks!"
891,2020-05-06 12:20:07,5,"As an educator I have valued this app all year. But now as a work at home educator, teacher mom to five kids, and do-er of all the things I am beyond grateful for Calm! I use the daily check ins for myself and my children; the meditation options have been so valuable for my kids as well as myself. We all also enjoy the music. And the sleep stories have changed my nightly routine for the better! Overall I am honestly grateful for this app now more than ever. I use it every day and sincerely thank you."
892,2020-10-30 02:29:24,3,"I love the idea behind this. The sleep stories are the best part, especially since you have a wide variety of voices to choose from.  Unfortunately, they almost always use the same two or three female voices for all of the meditation and daily calms, so if those voices and speaking patterns (like drawn out “s” sounds, over enunciated consonants and odd tone/inflections) grate on your nerves rather than soothe, there are entirely large chunks of the app that won’t work for you and absolutely no where but here in a review to comment on it. . . 
The master classes are nice too, but there are not as many of those."
893,2020-10-16 20:25:13,4,"I do really like calm. It is a little frustrating how they keep minimizing the lite version of it. There used to be five stories you could listen to without premium, but now there is only one. I mainly use it for background noise (rain, water, etc.) but sometimes I like to hear a story and now it’s just the same one on repeat. I don’t use it enough to activate a premium account. So if you use it often and really delve into it, I would recommend a premium account. It is still a nice app to have however just for once in a while uses!"
894,2020-04-10 13:53:05,5,"Tamara hit home with me when she shared her reflection on looking inward when we find ourselves in judgment or being irritated. I identify with always wondering why others aren’t working as hard as I am, but the reality is, I’m not giving myself the time to have self care like they are, rather I’m pushing myself to achieve that “something”. I could allow that something to be more self Love. Not a new concept, yet Progress, not perfection have always been my words to live by. Back to the breathe 🙏"
895,2020-01-05 16:27:06,5,"Every morning this year I have begun my day with the daily calm. I have only missed a few days. I truly believe it is working out for my mind every day. Outside of practice it has significantly deepened my ability to focus, to accept, to be calm and to be fully in the present moment.
Some people think the app is pricey. I have to say it is worth every penny. That’s half the price of a one time 1 hour counseling session.
Thank you for sharing your passion, gifts and beautiful heart with the world Tamara Leavitt!!

896,2020-04-03 14:48:00,3,"I like this app. It’s calming, stress relief, but the one problem is that there I too many locks for premium. I got this app, thinking about how I’m going to end the day, when I saw something that I really needed. But it was premium. 𝘖𝘬. 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘶𝘤𝘩 I said to myself, when I scroll down and EVERYTHING IS PREMIUM! I was upset. I was going to use this app and use it for its meaning. I would recommend this app if you would get premium, but for each type of meditation you only have three or four things that you can use. If they could lower the rate of premium, I would recommend this 100%"
897,2019-12-14 18:14:29,4,"Ok I love this app, everything on here is so calming, and when I’m done with a meditation, I feel amazing! But.... before I unlocked premium, there were to many things that cost. If you’re not going to go premium, then you can’t do that much at all really. But other than that, this app is so cool and calming. And also, ads rarely pop up! So that’s nice. But I think that not only me, but other people would like it if you unlocked a few more things. But everyone out there, if you’re willing to go premium, this app is totally worth it!"
898,2019-07-08 06:01:35,4,"When first entering the app, you are prompted to a free trial of one week, and after that one week you have to pay $70 for premium content. However, as many reviewers may not know is that there is an X at the top of the screen. At first I was disappointed with the content there was without premium, but soon there was an update, and things are much better than before. This update is convincing me that I should get premium!
Otherwise all of that I absolutely love this app, and I think every stressed human bean needs it.🙂"
899,2019-07-20 13:57:29,3,"This is a beautiful app and I think it’s really well done. However, it’s been a long time since I have done mindfulness meditations. I’m currently exploring the possibility of picking it back up regularly but 98% of the features on this app are locked unless you buy the subscription. A trial period with all or more of the features available to decide if this is really something I want to invest in would be really nice. (In all fairness, they have emailed me an offer for a discount but I still have to see if this is something I’m able to consistently do before I’m willing to spend that much money on it.)"
900,2019-07-03 14:44:01,5,"I have been a huge fan of calm since I downloaded it months ago but this last week has made me love it even more. I came down with a cold about a week ago. Like a bad one. Coughing uncontrollably, can’t sleep, tossing and turning, waking up every hour. Then I would turn on calm and I’d be asleep for the rest of the night!! I have only been able to get sleep during this sickness because of calm. It is the most amazing app and totally worth paying for the upgraded version. Thank you calm!!!!"
901,2019-06-11 07:20:31,5,"Trying to set aside time to meditate was a huge challenge before I discovered Calm. Now it is part of my nightly routine. 

What I love is the versatility of this program. There’s so much from which to choose. Not only can the user practice mindfulness, she can also explore healthy eating tips, exercise routines, and other interesting subjects for children, teens, and adults of all ages. 

Lately I’ve been enjoying the sleep stories to help me ease into sleep. Calm is one of the best self-improvement purchases I’ve ever made."
902,2018-01-07 02:18:52,5,"I have a fairly severe panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I’ve been struggling because I would rather not use medication if possible. This app is helping me feel like I /can/ regain control—hope that I haven’t had when battling anxiety thus far. The emergency calm meditation is a lifesaver for me during a panic attack. 

My psychologist recommended this to me after our last session. I highly recommend anyone who is on the fence to use this app. 

I upgraded to the monthly package not even a week into it."
903,2019-04-15 19:59:24,4,"The IPhone and iPad apps are great, however, there needs to be an easier way to organize your favorites. 

The new watch update has tremendous potential, but the execution is not there as the sound effects are out of sync with both the vibrations and the on screen animation. This results in an unpleasant experience, worse than not meditating at all. In addition, the watch meditations don’t appear to upload to the health app as mindful minutes. 

With a functioning watch app, this could be transformational, but the kinks need to be worked out."
904,2019-02-27 08:27:01,4,"This app has saved me a many restless nights. The guided meditations are well spoken, calming, and soothing. As a firefighter, sometimes it’s hard for me to fall back asleep when running calls throughout the evening, so I’ll turn on Calm and it truly helps me relax and drift to sleep. Now that I’ve been using the app for over a year, there is only one complaint. The sleep meditations never change. They have become predictable and not as effective. I wish they would update or add to the collection once a month at least. It’s the only reason for my 4 stars."
905,2018-10-28 03:06:20,2,"This app has really helped me with the stress and anxiety that comes with being a student. When considering the upgraded version I was almost certain I would purchase it.... until seeing the price of course. But the price isn’t the worst thing, it’s the fact that this app is demanding it all at once which can be rough for college students. We are filled with stress and anxiety about economics and finances until we find a simple remedy, but are quickly reminded again about these hardships when that remedy is posed as an arm and a leg to some of us. Yes of course it is worth it, but accessible monthly subscriptions may be a better price to advertise than yearly."
906,2017-09-05 21:45:47,5,"I've been using this app for about a year now and it was everything I was searching for when I first downloaded it. I plan to use this app for years to come, it's truly helped me make permanent changes in my life even for a simple 15 minutes a day. Plus they have sleep stories, which are fun and a great ways for me to find my center when I'm sleeping in new places or out on the road! I would and have already recommended this app to most of my friends and family!"
907,2020-04-13 17:48:11,5,"I have been having a lot of night struggles when I saw this app which my aunt recommended for me and then after all the reading after bedtime I open up the app and feel relaxed when it doesn’t help I listen to two or three song every time I wake up I feel so fresh that I never ever sleep through out the day I tried lavender in my room but it did not work if your having night struggles I highly recommend this for you and sleep well remember:SLEEP IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF COVID-19
Bye"
908,2020-08-07 08:07:22,3,"I absolutely love this app, I can’t sleep without it. The nights that I toss and turn or my mind won’t turn off, I put a story on and fall asleep in minutes. I use the free version but I have heard the same story so many times I end up reciting it to myself instead of falling asleep. I would love to subscribe to it but it is just TOO EXPENSIVE. I only use the stories and not the other features. I would love if I could subscribe only to the stories or certain features. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider a cheaper option. Or purchasing certain stories or features without the subscription."
909,2020-04-30 04:56:20,4,"This app is amazing, I’ve enjoyed it for the past couple weeks, but.. I’ve hated the fact they’ve put every single calming song or sleep or anything else locked. It’s been on my nerves for awhile and I hope for some to get unlocked. Almost everything is locked, I wanna reduce my stress and anxiety, but half of the anxiety plains that I believe that will help me is locked. I mean, my point is that, many people out there need this and they have to pay for it, but can’t. So please if you can unlock some of them, that’ll be must appreciated. Thank you."
910,2020-01-10 07:59:35,5,On day one I could relate with the speaker I myself have adhd and was also an irrational impulsive crazy person in my younger years with a lot of near death experiences and I was trying to find a way to relax to create peace in my mind and also fall asleep so I feel that this first day was really important to me and I also actually learned a lot enjoyed very much and look forward to tomorrow’s excercise thank you for teaching something new today very much enjoyed the experience
911,2020-02-12 12:18:15,2,"Hi i just downloaded Calm and i have to admit, it is really good. The only thing i have to complain about is that most of Calm requires premium. I know that it's all well and good for you because you are profiting from it, but I'm too young to pay for it and it really is annoying. I downloaded this because my other meditation app wasn't working only to find out that most of it costs money. Please please please please please please please please please please please please please please can you make more of it not premium? It's really unfair that you are charging money for all the sleep music and sleep stories and most other meditations. Once that happens I might give you more stars."
912,2020-02-10 01:17:46,4,"I really love most of the meditations on Calm. I have paid for the premium edition. I have a problem I have read others have. I don’t want to be be mean, but I can stand the tone and inflection of Tamara Levitt’s voice. It seems disingenuously upbeat and fake. It actually makes me cringe and I try to avoid things she narrates. It’s extremely hard because she seems to be the lead person. Does she have to do the Daily Calm every day? Please get different narrators with soothing voices. I am not sure if I will renew next year if you don’t. Thanks"
913,2019-10-21 11:23:32,5,"I love the Sleep Stories, especially those about star gazing and travel to remote places. Anna Acton, Alan Sklar, Jerome Flynn and other professionals have voices and styles that put me right to sleep. The 7 Days of Dealing with Pain narrated by Orin Jay Safer has been so important in guiding me through recovery from an accident & necessary knee surgery. I do think there is too much Tamara & she talks too much in the Daily Calm & the 7 day series she writes & narrates. I prefer longer periods of silence when I meditate & pull out my earbuds if she’s interrupting too much."
914,2019-10-23 13:52:06,4,"I enjoy this app and it has helped me through a lot of overwhelming anxiety. Not too long ago I found my sister after she killed herself and the bedtime stories have been a big help to distract me enough to sleep. Again I really do enjoy the app however, the bulk of everything is locked and as a new college student I don’t have the extra money to pay for a subscription (moreso for the meditations my therapist tells me is good for me) but I never seem to get through the first story before I’m asleep dreaming of lavender fields. Keep up the good work. Thank you"
915,2019-06-12 00:49:58,5,"Calm is a multifaceted app, with a ridiculous amount of content. I’ve meditated for years, and I can tell you even if your an advanced meditator it’s great as a healthy reminder. The soundscapes, music, and calm kiddo section makes teaching meditation to your kids super easy aswell. While I’ve been out of commotion with Lymes Disease, this has been a god send to just prompt my sappy when in bed, and can’t move it’s downrite lovely! I will spend the 60 bucks to purchase the whole app very soon! Cheers, and enjoy."
916,2019-02-17 12:56:22,5,I used simple habit for nearly a year.  The fundamental difference in my experience in the past week is the amount of time for actual meditation that’s built into each session.  In simple habit the narration is so constant it’s difficult to simply sit and focus on the breath for awhile.  Calm has a few minutes at a time that are allotted simply for this purpose.  Thus far I have also found the actual narration more conducive to meditation and concentration.  I’ll be going premium on this app.  A definite win.
917,2018-11-06 11:58:01,5,"I have thoroughly searched for another meditation app.  I thought, “if this one is my first, and as amazing as it is, what else is there?”  Nothing.  There’s no app this amazing!  Calm has changed my life, introduced me to meditation, and taught me how to meditate and self-direct my own meditation.  It’s a true teacher with gradual release.  When you need guidance, it gives you guidance.  When you need to be alone, it allows you time with yourself for self-guided meditation.  This is the BEST meditation app you will find and rivals that of meditation classes."
918,2018-11-20 04:45:59,2,"I wanted to try this out because I saw all the ad rolls on Facebook. Figured it couldn’t hurt to see what I could get for free before maybe going for a subscription  It gives you one free Sleep Story and two free 5-10 minute mediations (The first of the 7 Days of Calm/Sleep respectively) but other than that, literally nothing else is free and they shove a subscription in your face. And a yearly one at that! Nothing else is even offered. I’m not paying $60 a year for something I saw barely anything of. Only giving this 2 stars because the one free Sleep Story they had was narrated by Stephen Fry, who can never do wrong. This app could do a lot better at the outset."
919,2018-11-18 12:20:08,1,"Before I paid $39/yr for this app (got it on sale) I researched others out there. Calm sounded pretty good!  It’s not user friendly at all!!  The stories are not very appealing. Some of the voices are kinda creepy. Not calming at all. I hadn’t used it for awhile. Thought I’d try it again-it is 4:11am & I’m still wide awake. When I opened the app all I saw was a picture of a lake with a mountain behind it. When I tap the screen, nothing happens. If I scroll right or left a new ‘calming picture’ appears. There’s only 3 different pictures. What a waste!  Would love to get a refund. I remember wishing there was a monthly subscription available. I think there’s a reason they don’t offer one-people would cancel after one month!"
920,2018-04-16 06:52:00,5,"New to meditation? Get this app. I downloaded this app (and a few others) as a last ditch effort to help ease my anxiety, depression, and PTSD. WOW! This app blew the competition away and is the only app I use daily now. My mind used to get so busy at night, but this app has helped me learn to slow down and focus on grounding. There are a lot of free options to try out, but I did end up purchasing a subscription because the daily calm + sleep stories are lifesavers (the emergency calm is as well!). Thank you Calm! You rock."
921,2018-02-07 11:47:40,5,"Only day 2 and I am feeling better 🙏🏼I find it easy to get it done in the early morning when the day is quiet. I am
only doing 10 minutes and after I finish a week successfully I plan to do another 10 min during my lunch dreak - I have no expectations and just going with what I am asked by the practice - I know it is going to bring some clamness as I am already experiencing that. Thank You for making an app that is a must need in today’s stressful lifestyles"
922,2017-12-21 10:08:32,5,"I am really struggling with so many things in my life right now....depression, stress, worry, poor sleep etc. At first I thought I would only use the free version of this app because I thought there was no way I would spend that much money on an app subscription. But after trying out the free features and seeing how it’s helped me calm down so much, I’m happy to pay. I look forward to these meditations and already feel calm as soon as I hear the app sounds. Thanks you to the makers of Calm!!!"
923,2018-02-02 07:43:23,4,"Great app - get it. I just wish they'd fix two things:

-sleep stories and meditations assume you sleep on your back...with no explanation of if/why that's important. As a lifelong side sleeper, this continually annoys me and distracts me a bit when they're taking you through meditations as if you're supposed to be on your back

-the warning every time when I stop playing a track. I get it. How many ppl do you think care about the tracking anyway? Tell me once and that's enough. I only stop things anyway bc I want to start over."
924,2021-01-17 14:33:55,5,"People have lost there minds and way and this is a great start to reconnect to yourself. Easy not complicated. Only recommendation is for people like my wife, there needs to be a baby step real short meditations to walk a person to what there really trying to find. It’s just that some people just focus  on time so shorter till there capacity is longer. Thats my only complaint. Also food suggestions like  Indian theravedics or basic Buddhist diets . It be nice touch for morning start."
925,2017-12-19 10:47:23,2,"I downloaded this app two days ago and absolutely loved the meditations. However immediately after meditating on the second day, my phone started doing this thing where it restarted/crashed every two minutes or so. I didn’t see the correlation to the app at first, but then I actually went and bought a new phone. When I downloaded and used the app again, my brand new phone started doing it too! I couldn’t believe it. I had my husband download it just to see and his started doing it too. It didn’t stop until I removed the app from my phone. Hopefully they’ll get this bug fixed because I really enjoyed the meditations!"
926,2021-01-06 17:35:33,5,"Have used this app for over a year now. Love the body scan,sleep stories and the sleep music
 Last night I fell asleep to the sound of firefly lullaby which was amazing, Yes I was having difficulty falling asleep and feeling somewhat anxious. Going to listen to that one again tonight. The description said it was based on science and I believe it because it worked. Every time I started ruminating there was a sound that brought me away from the thoughts and back to peace . Amazing.
 Highly recommend Calm!"
927,2020-12-22 13:38:38,5,This app allows me to take a few minutes out of every day to center myself and to realize I'm not so crazy and the world is not so crazy.  Taking these few moments to be still and breathe catapults me with confidence and focus into the rest of the day.  The hardest thing to do is to stop and take time to do those things that help us the most.  Calm is there to allow me to take care of myself in an effortless way.  I am so grateful after each session that I did this.
928,2020-12-24 17:06:29,2,"I have the full paid version which was gifted to me since I do use another meditation app frequently that I love. I was excited at first to get new options. However I don’t like Calm, it is very inflexible. Too many things are only narrated by Tamara and for me her voice is annoying. She does virtually all the sleep meditations. Also for me I like to choose shorter meditations. Everything is so long. I don’t need 30-45 min to go to sleep. Prefer a 10-15 min option. The sleep stories are also very long and more like audiobooks instead of  meditation to me. 

So I do recommend trying the free version first before buying. I won’t be renewing when my gift expires."
929,2020-04-22 07:49:37,5,"This app is amazing! It has breathing expertises to help you sleep, or for anxiety. It has calming music, soundscapes, stories for sleep- overall it is amazing! It does require a subscription but it is absolutely worth it!
I have one request for the creators. Would it be possible to add ASMR onto the app? A lot of people fall asleep very easily to ASMR, but not much else, and so I believe it would be a good way to help more people fall asleep easily. Thank you for reading my review, and I truly hope you decide to add ASMR to the app!"
930,2020-08-22 14:56:09,4,"I actually really like this app. The sleep stories helped a lot with my insomnia and there are other options for meditation, mental clarity etc. however, with ALL the stories, sessions and albums they have shown on this app, 95% of them are locked and can only be accessed if you sign up to pay 70$ for the year. It was challenging finding a session or story that wasn’t locked and didn’t have much options. I believe they help and I’m debating on paying, I just wish I had more options before deciding."
931,2020-05-29 11:08:13,2,"I have paid for this app bc I really love the meditations and especially the sleep stories. I've been using this for over a year and listening to them every night to fall asleep, especially listening to my favorite reader, Alan Sklar. I have a painful illness that makes it hard to sleep, but since I discovered this it has made a huge difference in my life. Until recently. It crashes every single night. I try it over and over and sometimes it will start and I hold my breath hoping it won't crash. By the 7th or 8th try I'm so aggravated that I'm anything but Calm! I have not found a way to contact them which is also frustrating."
932,2020-04-25 21:06:36,3,"I love using this app, but I initially knew that I only wanted to subscribe for about a month (which costs $15) due to how tight expenses are right now during the coronavirus pandemic. This app gives you a 7-day trial, but then afterwards instead of allowing me to choose which option I want for a subscription, it just automatically charged me $60 for a yearlong subscription. I probably could’ve checked sooner, but I assumed that I’d be given the chance to pick a type of plan instead of being locked in for a year."
933,2020-04-17 12:53:36,5,"Ummm, this is a good app and all, but the fact that I can’t access anything other than BEDTIME STORIES without having to have a free trial is RIDICULOUS! Like really? Also, WHAT THE HECK, why only children’s bedtime stories without it? I mean, I’m a 7 year old girl and I’M the instructor of my Mom when she meditates! I really want you to be more open with your choices. Until then, this rating is still 3 stars. Hmmph! >:( oh, wait never mind! I just saw another rating that says you can access the scenes! :) you get 4 stars though, but BE GREATFUL"
934,2020-04-11 16:48:08,5,"^^it is , and a lot of people face depression amid all the horrible things happening in the world. This app is great for a deep, analytical thinker, who’s an optimist but finds it hard to always be happy. This app gives you the gift of fresh perspective. I think it’d be a total personal investment for myself to subscribe to the year of unlocking the full app, based on what I’ve seen in the free content so far. This app you can meditate and listen to an audiobook all at once, two things I know I should do but don’t ever do."
935,2019-09-28 12:05:12,5,"This is the best app I’ve ever purchased. I don’t go one day without using it at LEAST once. I never thought I could be someone that meditated but I use calm everyday and I’ve even convinced many of my friends to start. I have noticed meditation have an impact on every single area of my life. I’ve been using the app a year and 3 months. I love it. 

If you’re thinking of meditating and just don’t know where to start this where to start. 

Update: still using this app and still love every minute."
936,2019-10-31 04:54:36,1,"I was able to do on or two things but everything is locked !!  Come on you can’t share more free time then that !! Your subscription price is not cheap so if you want people to get a real feel for what you have to have free then show us what you have !! 
I went right to two other apps offering the same type of service. Yes they have locked items also but all of yours is locked except one or two things.  Give a little more of yourself and your service and you might get more subscriptions and you might actually help more people who need this !!   Have a heart not just deep pockets !!  Very disappointed"
937,2019-09-24 11:12:18,5,"Tried the night time stories first on American Airlines transatlantic. Would put seat down, pull up blanket and lay head on pillow while listening with Bose earphones to the melodious yet calming voice of Erik Ba. Fell in love listening to the Nordic Train and have had many pleasant hours of sleep. 

When I found this app and it has the Nordic Train- I had to purchase it. There is so much more that is available to discover and loving every minute of the guided mediations; to the sleep stories. 

Kudos for creating such a mindful and healing app!"
938,2019-05-08 01:45:26,5,"This helps me so so so much! I can never sleep or focus and this has helped me do both! I also have really bad stress and anxiety it has helped calm me down really well! Its like free therapy sessions, there are some you have to purchase but there are also a variety of free ones too which are the ones I use. I dont think theres anything I dislike even the people talkings voices are calming this is just a perfect app I have 100% no dislikes or complaints! Great job whoever created this you have helped me a lot!!"
939,2019-04-17 02:26:18,5,"I download this app originally for meditation and spa. It’s hard to let the bebe sleep daytime, and he was getting crazy. I played “sleep music” hope it could calm him down, but I didn’t expect it would work. I left the bedroom and was doing my stuff. The bébé was no longer crying, and when I came to check him, he had already been asleep. It’s a magic and saves my life. The app is not designed for children under 4, but it’s a nice attempt to see whether your baby likes it."
940,2019-03-31 12:23:28,5,"We are at a point in time that is too remarkable to fully describe. I suppose all times seem such to many people. Think and recognize who the thinker is and then wonder why am I thinking at all. It brings us to the creator. Thoughtfulness has so many forms the most important of which is to use your thoughts to do the best you can. When you see the world as it is you can only be amazed at the miracles that exist everywhere, always.
Ever moment is eternal....
To love is to be God"
941,2019-03-06 04:23:31,5,"I just love this app because it has given me just enough structure to make meditation a regular part of my life. I love the positive messages that are delivered along with the meditations especially in the daily calm. Of course I feel I could do better by meditating longer Or deeper like most people, but I have also learned that just sitting down for meditation has extremely great benefits and itself regardless of how I think I’m doing. I strongly recommend the Calm app if you’d like to make  meditation A habit."
942,2018-11-30 02:28:56,5,I was on the train and noticed all the impending signs of a panic attack. I got off at the next stop (if I’d had a panic attack on the train it would have had to be delayed and delaying a train in NYC is a cardinal sin) and found a seat on the platform. As I was trying to pull myself together — and failing — I remembered this app that I hadn’t used in a while and opened it. I listened to the first mediation for the 21 days of calm and I quickly felt my panic secede. By the end of the meditation I was calmer and felt okay enough to get on the next train. Thanks!
943,2017-09-17 11:42:46,5,"I have been using this app about one month. I find I look forward each morning to the Daily Calm which always has a little nugget of wisdom to think about. I especially like the bedtime stories to fall asleep to. There is a wide range of soothing background sounds and music. I like the SunsetBeach the most of any ocean background sounds I have ever tried. Just the right rhythm and best of all, a sea gull noise that is faint not intrusive   It has been designed with great care and it shows."
944,2017-08-28 19:40:57,5,"For years I had been searching for some form of teaching tool to help me learn how to meditate successfully without any luck.  I happened to learn about CALM quite accidentally and gave it a try not expecting much.  Thankfully I was very wrong. There are a wide variety of sessions to choose from depending on what you need or want to focus on on any given day and I find them to be very helpful in giving me insight and yes, a sense of daily calm.  I highly recommend trying this app."
945,2020-11-20 00:38:20,5,I use the Calm app everyday and I use all different features.   I’m the worst sleeper but the sleep stories have made a huge difference for me in getting to sleep and if I wake up in the middle of the night (although I don’t usually last very long before I fall asleep!). Erik Braa (spelling?) is my fave. The guided meditations are good for beginners and has a lot of variety and I’ve recently been enjoying the new music addition.  Kygo Golden Hour mix is such a wonderful ending to the day. Would highly recommend.
946,2020-02-29 12:34:18,5,"I started using the app after seeing an add on tv of lebron James using it, and I decided to get it to help me focus and learn how to meditate being that I’m a young basketball player and I go through a lot of stress sometimes, thinking about games, practices and other things weather it be on or off the court, and so far it’s helped me focus and stay in the moment, and just embrace it for what it is.I’m hopping and think that this app is going to help me learn how to focus more and grow more mentally as I use it."
947,2020-01-12 16:08:12,5,"This is an essential app for anyone in school, stressful situations, unable to sleep, and many other mental issues. The subscription is completely worth it. I have been using this app every night for its sleep stories and everyday in stressful classes for its scenes. I like how the app lets you record your overall daily emotions and sets reminders for when you need to get ready for bed and to ask how you are feeling and for reminders on mindfulness classes. It also does various guided naps."
948,2019-11-28 16:44:14,5,"As an NCC working toward licensure I couldn’t be more pleased with how this app incorporates principles like traditional mindfulness, CBT, emotional awareness, and even developmentally-appropriate courses for kids. I don’t have kids of my own but was so impressed that they break down the child meditations into 2-3 year windows.
I’ve especially enjoyed the sleep meditations, the Anxiety Release, the Pain meditations, and the body scans. The emergency calm works, too! Highly, highly recommend. I just pay the $60 one time a year."
949,2019-10-22 12:40:53,5,Calm taught me how to make meditation a daily habit-it also taught me it’s okay to miss a day or two! It acts as an anchor of confidence and well...calm in my day. I’ve been using Calm personally for years and just recently started using the meditations and blog materials in my mental health non-profit curriculum. My adult students love the meditations and express that Calm makes it easy for them to dive deeper without opening old wounds. I tell everyone about this app. 100% would download again and again.
950,2019-04-07 23:24:32,5,"This app has been such a gift for me.  It was recommended to me to help with anxiety and restlessness I was struggling with.  Through the daily mediations and the meditations for specific needs I have developed a practice that has helped immensely.  Additionally, the master classes have led me to more research from experts on topics like happiness.  I have learned so much from this app and feel more fulfilled in general.  I was hoping this app would help -it has not only helped but changed me for the better! Thank you so much Calm creators!!"
951,2019-03-19 13:40:45,5,"This app will have a different effect on everyone, so don’t have too many expectations based on reviews. It helped and helps me a lot to one condition: doing it every single day whether I feel like it or not. It’s like going to the gym. You don’t need to pay if you don’t want to / can’t , but if 70$/year is no big deal for you, do it. I’v been using the app for 3 months and can observe some change in my daily life. Let’s see how it goes for the coming years (hopefully)..."
952,2019-03-10 18:22:00,5,"I’m the type of person who doesn’t (or didn’t) feel the desire to seek peace and calming techniques from an app. The idea was ridiculous. But then, I decided I had nothing to lose from trying. Here I am, after my first session, feeling so at ease, so focused. I’m impressed. I’ll be keeping the service after my 7 day trial is up. I may even try some of these techniques with my students! Thank you to the developers of Calm for an app that has clearly been created with care and intent."
953,2018-04-30 14:32:57,5,"Absolutely LOVE this app. I struggle with anxiety and depression and mild sleep depreciation and this app helps me combat those experiences in a way that is putting ME IN CONTROL. Incredibly grateful for that. SO relaxing and i love the lady’s voice, especially comparable to other apps I’ve tried. I also love that you can change the themes depending on your mood, which is Ofcourse ever changing. This can be used as a tool in your “mental tool box” to keep your mind and body balanced and content. Which is what we’re all striving for right?"
954,2019-02-14 15:32:40,3,"It’s difficult to know how great this app is from the free meditations alone. Like other meditation apps, they bait you with scant free beginner meditations to get you to unlock content that you pay a monthly subscription for. There is very little free content, and what there is is just OK.  In a 12 minute anxiety meditation, the first three minutes is a bunch of beginner blah blah about the benefits of meditation that I already know. Then you get into the meditation part. It is not compelling enough for me to want to pay more. They give you a seven day free trial and then start charging you. Typical free app that is simply a front for a subscription service."
955,2019-01-29 04:14:04,3,"Ok so I think that this app is cool but... it mainly all is locked which means u have to pay money to unlock, and the free things are kinda boring. I have not been using this app for a while but the 7 days of sleep thing ACTUALLY wind up working and I fell asleep before the time tunes out. Over all I don’t know if I would suggest getting this app unless u want to spend money or need help sleeping. I only got the app because I needed to try something to help me to fall asleep so when I get up in the morning for school then I have enough sleep the get me threw the day not just on the bus. But I think that this app is real and works."
956,2018-06-30 00:53:45,1,"Once you have finished a session, it is impossible to go back and repeat unless you manually keep track of what day you are on. It should be a simple thing to just reset the session but no. This appears to be beyond the capabilities of the Calm app people. If you don't remember you are in day 16 of the 21 days of calm, too bad. It's up to you to keep track of what session you are on. Ridiculous.

UPDATE

These app guys could screw up a two car parade. They can't do a simple reset on a completed program and now they have to gussie it up so the whole thing is a confusing mess, assuming you are even able to get it to work. Best advice is to listen to a headspace session before trying to wrestle with the Calm app.

UPDATE

Get the free OAK app from Kevin Rose. It is free and the breathing exercises are great. I like the voiceover in calm because it explains a lot but that’s headwork not meditation. They should start with a five minute intro followed by 10 minutes of meditation without the incessant talking.

Wait. A year later i just heard back from Calm Support. They are sorry (true). Great customer support. Great."
957,2017-12-25 11:44:31,5,I have been in the practice of using guided meditations for 5 years. I have been using the Calm App for 3 months now. The daily Calm and special meditations have helped my practice and self turn the corner to a deeper understanding of my presence and others around me. The inventory is vast just as we are and I look forward to each days personal development within myself and in all my interactions and relationships with others. Thank you Tamara ... I am happy even without being able to do a headstand!
958,2017-10-18 14:31:21,5,"I’ve recently had trouble sleeping, and started listening to this app because a friend recommended the Sleep Stories. Listening to those or doing a 10 min relaxing body scan has made a world of difference in my ability to fall asleep, stay asleep and sleep well. Thank you Calm!! 

Ps - The subscription is well worth it. There are endless recordings on the app and more being added constantly. Even if you just use the app for the breath visualizer, it’s so very worth it."
959,2017-09-08 04:18:17,5,"I absolutely Love ""Calm!"" It really gives me that much needed time to myself while being led in simple but So rewarding quiet time for me. I can focus and relax. In doing so it really allows me to hear things about me that are needed to help me to grow and be healthy. Also, I always have my phone so my ""Calm"" App is with me so I don't need to head to the gym, etc. I can enjoy this time where ever I am. I am still learning about ""Calm"" so I am sure there is much more to enjoy! Thank You So Much and God Bless You and the ""Calm"" team. ❤️"
960,2021-01-08 11:04:53,5,"I can’t praise this app enough. The 10 min Daily Calm is part of my morning routine and sets me up for a better day.  It centers me, grounds me, calms me.  It helps me become more focused throughout my day.  My thoughts are less scattered. Tamara Levitt’s voice is soothing. The stories and lessons she teaches are life-giving. I’ve had to manage anxiety and depression my entire life.  Incorporating this 10 min routine each morning for the past year, along with other treatments, has been quite healing. Thanks to the entire Calm team."
961,2020-12-19 14:13:35,5,"I’m on this medication that causes insomnia, and I’ve been taking melatonin every night to combat it but it doesn’t work very well. I get like 3 hours of sleep a night. So I downloaded this at like 1 am because I saw an ad. And the next thing I know, I wake up at 9 am. It was like magic. I haven’t had 8 hours of sleep at once in... months. I actually forgot I downloaded it until I opened my phone and saw it. Definitely amazing, hope it keeps working!"
962,2020-08-17 14:10:43,5,"Good things: most all sleep stories, background scene sounds; music selections, variety of meditation methods 
Not so good: sleep story narrators with “affected” timbre, too fast or high pitched, not relaxing and grates on the nerves
Really bad: App doesn’t load properly! It takes several times trying for it to finally stay open!! Even when it appears to be open, it isn’t. It just times out over and over and won’t open. Takes forever to stay open properly. Maddening!!!"
963,2020-06-15 14:56:09,5,"I have known that meditation is the pathway to a calmer, less stressful life.  I have NEVER been able to maintain a practice beyond a week or so.  And I have tried so many approaches and apps.  Jeff Warren’s 30 day program for developing a consistent practice is groundbreaking.  I am on day 17 and I look forward to every lesson because of the new nuggets he offers every day.  But it is SO much more.  I am still discovering new, valuable content.  Calm Premium is well worth the price!"
964,2020-05-31 12:13:25,5,"I struggle and suffer with deep depression, anxiety, and stress, since I’ve been listening to the read along and the different sounds it has humbled and relaxed me mentally, physically and emotionally. I tend to fall asleep with the app still playing in my ear. It soothes my mind. Keeping my brain from over thinking, keeping me clear minded and feeling free is a feeling the sounds give me. Rain drops and water sounds are my favorite. You must download, I promise you will not be disappointed. 🤍"
965,2020-02-28 01:44:37,5,I heard about Calm on a podcast commercial. I’m usually skeptical of all of these self improvement apps that I pay a small fortune for and forget to use. I’m looking at you Duo Lingo. Well let me just say as a licensed amateur (ham) radio operator I know sometimes it can be difficult to clear my head and get sleep that people recommend these days. I use sleep stories and the music on this program to rest. My favorite is the Shipping Forecast. Just thinking about it is making my eyelids heavy.
966,2020-05-26 11:34:08,1,"It’s ridiculous to pay this much for an app that can’t even play in the background. The app has to be open and your phone unlocked the entire night/time in order for it to play - whether you’re listening to a story or nature sounds. Not only does this drain my battery (and no, I cannot keep it plugged in to charge all night because I need to use the port to listen through my headphones so the story/noises don’t bother my partner), but it’s a security and privacy issue leaving your phone unlocked all night. I am going to try and get my money back, but I just don’t get why this app can’t run in the background. Would be 5 stars if it could. But this way it’s utterly useless."
967,2020-05-11 17:15:07,1,"I did not like this game and here’s why as a young kid like not even a teen yetI don’t have the time and money to pay 60 something dollars for all of them .basically and I could only do like 2 things on their and if it’s just me Um I don’t think that’s necessary for a game maybe you would pay for the app and then get everything on it I won’t be downloading this game EVER AGAIN 
                                                      I hope your happy 😡😤😑 oh and by the way people who read this try antistress toys it’s fun and relaxing and the quit pack only cost 99 cents and that’s it no tax or anything and you don’t need to have a weekly trial or anything or any of the antistress games and none of them cost$$$$$$$$$$"
968,2019-12-31 11:50:59,5,I enjoy the app though still haven’t decided if it’s worth the price for me given all the free content out here today. After my year subscription I will have a better idea. It would be useful if there was the ability to do a word or tag search for content allowing me to get the most out of the app and discover additional content I’m interested. This seems to be a basic feature that I’m surprised this app doesn’t have.
969,2019-12-31 08:05:31,5,I started a non profit recently. What I’m finding is that the response and feedback make all the difference to me - the reciprocity of community...and so I’ve been debating whether to continue or how to proceed because the response has been less than what I hoped for or less than the unmeasurable whole-hearted effort I put into it. If I choose to move forward then perhaps I need to change my focus on what I expect to receive back. Thank you 🙏🏼
970,2019-11-22 07:30:12,5,"I love the app, it’s easy to use and full of really fantastic useful content. I downloaded it to help me sleep and it’s been very helpful. I have one suggestion, can you make it possible to create playlists or set another audio to play after the one you’re listening to, cause some of the sleep ones aren’t long enough and it would be nice if I could just have two or three play without me having to manually put another one on."
971,2019-05-29 02:16:38,5,"Seriously love this app! My boyfriend and i have incorporated it into our nightly routine and we truly feel such a positive difference in our mental abilities going through our days. Meditation is so simple yet so so powerful. I truly recommend to anyone and EVERYONE, especially in this hectic and busy world we live in! Calm offers so many different meditations, i truly love it so much! I’m so glad i finally went premium and get to use all of the features now! 10/10 recommend!"
972,2019-10-18 11:37:06,4,I’ve listened to about 160 sessions now and have overall really enjoyed it and have found it really helpful and something I look forward to each day. The one thing I’m a little annoyed by is the narrators voice at times. She can tend to say things in an over dramatic tone that kind of gets old. I did notice there are now sessions available with a male voice that sounds a little less mystical. I think that’s a good solution so I’m hoping they provide multiple readers to every session eventually.
973,2019-03-04 23:27:06,5,"After suffering many losses in my life, and since losing my partner couple of years ago, I could not imagine my life going forward. Some of my friends suggested to to me Calm, and ever since I tried it, it has change my life for better.

Daily I meditate for about 10 minutes, and every time afterwards, I feel refreshed and rejuvenated to a point that I see possibilities in life for better tomorrow!

Thank you Calm, and thank you to all of the people making this App terrific!"
974,2018-04-05 20:06:23,5,"Over the years I have tried about a dozen meditation apps. Calm is by far and away the best that I've ever come across.

Dove deep into the app on Int’l Calm Day. There is so much more to this app than I originally thought. As an example,I usually have chatter in my head as I try to sleep. I’m going to give Bedtime Stories a go. Plus I’m intrigued by the lectures they have.

I use Calm daily for breathing exercises and meditation. I now realize that I've only scratched the surface of its capabilities. I suggest that you definitely, give it a go!"
975,2018-08-01 12:39:14,1,"I tried their 7 days to relieve anxiety. Day 1 was fine, very helpful 12 minutes. I go to do Day 2 before hitting the gym and.. have to activate the free 7 day trial. Do that, then had to download content, that’s not possible until I register, but it throws up a “poor network connection” the gateway failure. After wasting a few minutes trying to make that work, I cancelled the trial which worked fine - no network or gateway errors. If the app mentioned at the end of the day 1 meditation that day2 would require the trial and the other BS it would have been fine I suppose. But this - offering 1 of 7 days free, followed by a flawed process to register than try to download comes across as scummy to me."
976,2018-03-06 12:24:22,5,"I’ve used this for two weeks in the mornings now before getting ready for work and have been enjoying life more than ever. I’m finally becoming more contented. Learning to breath and notice our thought patterns without jumping on them for a long ride is an incredible tool psychologically, physiologically, spiritually and emotionally. I love this as a Christian but it’s not inherently religious whatsoever. I also LOVE the sounds and video scenes, which are also such a treasure to pull out from your phone and Bluetooth earpiece."
977,2018-03-07 20:16:59,4,"I use the app mainly for the sleep stories. They’re great for falling asleep! I also like the white noises they offer, but they stop after about 45 sec to 1 minute, which is not very relaxing. I have the settings so sounds play outside the app, and the stories work great while I use other apps or while screen is locked playing through Bluetooth speaker. Even when app is open, the white noise cuts off. I could download another white noise app, but I’m already paying an arm and a leg for this one so I wish it was usable."
978,2018-03-06 04:51:42,5,"I have been using this app a little over a year now and I just need to say thank you. I  was recently diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PTSD and I can honestly say this has been my savor. If I need to get my breathing back to normal, help falling asleep or just that little recharge for the day, this has it all- so it’s an app for everyone’s benefit. Putting on one of the Relaxing tracks before bed put me in a trance of my happiest moments which I haven’t thought of in a very long time. Thank you for letting me breathe."
979,2018-02-27 15:09:41,5,"This app bookends my day with quiet time and a meditation in the morning and a meditation or sleep story as I drift to sleep. I’ve tried other meditation apps, but Calm provides the perfect blend of music, meditation and sleep stories. It’s worth every penny and more!

For years, I’ve had difficulty sleeping and thanks to the Calm essential oil spray and a nighttime meditation, more often than not I am able to get a restful night of sleep.  If I do wake up in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep, I just put on a sleep story and it keeps my mind from spinning.

The number and variety of meditation topics and durations give me just the messages I need no matter what situation I’m involved.

If you are new to meditation and mindfulness or have been practicing for years, I think you will find benefit from this amazing app. I can truly say my life is enriched by Calm."
980,2017-10-06 05:45:15,5,"Love, love, love this app! It definitely helps me with relaxing & unwinding after a stressful day. A lot of the times when I'm listening to the Daily Calm sessions I usually fall asleep while I'm listening. 

I haven't been as nervous & tensed after listening to the daily sessions which is good cause before there wasn't anything I could do to help me relax. I was as tight as a rubber band. Thanks to Facebook for suggesting your app or I would have never tried it or knew about it. Thanks again & I also love the sleep stories!!!"
981,2017-12-28 15:02:47,3,"I feel a little duped. It shows up as a free app, and I do understand the reasoning for needing to have paid content. However, please be aware that the free version is essentially a mini trial version of the program. You have access to 7 days to calm, the first exercise of a few other programs, the breathing bubble, and sleep stories. 

However, I’m here for the meditation programs, in particular the anxiety and stress relief programs. 

I have enjoyed the content I have been able use and am considering the year subscription (with a reminder set to cancel it after a year). I think that if the programs work, a year is longer than what you need for guidance unless they continue adding very new and very different content. 

Because of their expectation for you to pay for 90% of their content, I wish they’d offer a free week trial, because I feel like I’m shelling out a lot of money for something that I’m not sure I’ll like. 

That said, I"
982,2017-09-25 12:30:29,5,"This app is so helpful. It is great for beginners to help you understand the method of mindful meditation and the full priced app gives you so many options for multiple types of meditation that support any need. It is the only app I use after trying several.  After trying the free version, I have purchased the full app and I find it worth every penny. There are so many different meditations that I can always find something appropriate for anything I need. I highly recommend this app."
983,2017-08-29 13:03:38,5,It's such a comfort to know that I have Calm as my partner in my Meditation practice! I love all the choices in musical backgrounds..the voice of the young lady that guides us...the format and the choices. I have been a student of Meditation for 24 years..and I can completely attest to the absolute fact for new comers or practiced practitioners...a commitment to Meditation will change you(for good things) from the inside out❤️❤️❤️One practice at a time.. Thank you all so very much at Calm....Doing a tremendous service for our world...😘😘
984,2021-01-13 11:42:28,5,Love this app! I have been using it for 2.5 years now and it has helped me to be consistent in my meditation practice. I look forward to to the time to myself each morning and I love the little “gold nugget” of wisdom the Tamara leaves with each listener at the end of each session that gives me a helpful concept to consider throughout my day. And the additional Spark sessions are interesting and helpful short listening segments and the masterclasses are enlightening as well! Get this app!!
985,2021-02-21 02:58:56,2,"I’ve used this app for a little over a year and love it. Love the sleep stories, check ins, and the meditations. But sadly, I (and a bunch of other people too apparently) can’t use it anymore because I’ve just been stuck on the take a deep breath screen for weeks now. I thought they would fix it, but I guess not. I would cancel my subscription but it just renewed and I’ve already paid for the year, so if at some point between now and the end of the year the fix it. I will happily revise this review because it is a great app but since I’ve already paid for an entire year I would like to be able to use it."
986,2020-12-28 23:23:29,5,"I’m seriously impressed with this app. I wasn’t sleeping at night because I couldn’t turn my brain off. Through daily meditation and a relaxing session before bed, I’m sleeping!!!  For the times I can’t sleep, I am at peace with it and can enjoy the relaxation. 

For a Type-A person this is seriously a game changer. I’m accepting the things I can’t change and am more mindful in my everyday life. 

Trust me, the paid version is worth it if you can dedicate even 10 minutes a day."
987,2020-04-22 11:37:23,5,I never thought I would be a person who would be into meditation but I am changing my views today this is just the best tool I have found I have never felt more relaxed.  I can’t wait to keep using this daily.  Anyone feeling emotionally drained like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders...you feel like you have to do it all (type a) all the way...this is for you!  This is a chance to realign yourself to find the you that you have been missing!!!
988,2019-12-01 17:29:08,5,"This app has changed my life for the better. I am calmer, happier, more peaceful than I ever have been. I have enjoyed every meditation I've done--but don’t miss the “How to Meditate” series! 

I also really like the ""Breathe"" meditation. Though it is modifiable, I use it as is to take a moment here and there to still myself, re-center myself, and/or de-stress. It's amazing. 

I also love their sleep sounds and sleep stories. I listen to a sleep story as I go to bed, and, if I wake, I play Thunderstorms, my favorite. On occasion, I just play the sounds to settle down and focus into something. 

Last year I upgraded to the lifetime membership. It was a relief to do so, because I can’t imagine being without my Calm app. It’s the best money I ever spent—and it was on sale! Do yourself a favor and get the full, paid version of Calm; you won’t regret it."
989,2020-04-17 07:52:03,1,"My first experience with this app was very disappointing. I wrote about my original problems, mostly being that the app was entirely concerned with getting $70 dollars out of someone who was seeking a cheaper substitute to other sleep remedies. After writing my original post, I was sent an ad for 40% off. It’s wonderful to see that the app developers way of helping their customer was to just have them pay for a $40 app. You could only imagine how comforting it was to see that the remedy to my disappointment was to still spend an entire weeks worth of grocery money o  an application to help me sleep better, especially during this stressful pandemic. The lack of empathy in this company is truly staggering."
990,2019-10-19 22:51:34,5,"I’m unsure if this will be seen and/or posted on the landing page but, Calm app creators, thank you. This app has helped me, enabled me and made me beyond intentional about my overall wellness. My functionality has improved as well as my sleep. My meditation sessions has allowed me to turn spaces of havoc and chaos into safe havens. With the help of the calm app, my wellbeing and stability are back on track. I am more than appreciative for what this app has contributed not only to my life, but the lives of others."
991,2019-11-28 17:11:59,1,I really appreciate the river sounds in the ocean sounds when you start up the app it’s the best feature but if you have unlocked every single meditation this would’ve been five stars if you want $49 a year then make it on bed and sleep monitor This is hands-down the worst app I love all the lullabies but really I’m not paying $49 per year know if you are going to put all this on you guys even recommend this in the health app $49 a year come on so we have to pay $80 for just two years Cut out all the premium stuff and make everything unlocked so I don’t have to drop my reading solo I would’ve loved this app if all this premium stuff went away
992,2019-06-08 04:39:09,5,"Definitely worth it! I have such a hard time sleeping (bedtime or even just naps) but not even halfway through a story (about a half hour or so each) I’ll be asleep. It definitely helps to calm me down after a long day, and to shut my mind down. Definitely worth a try if you struggle to sleep like I do. I was for sure very skeptical at first, but thought I would give it a try since I had a free trial, and now I use it every night. I definitely highly recommend! 🌙💤🌟"
993,2019-01-15 12:37:50,5,"I’ve dedicated myself to setting daily routines in an effort to gain consistency, organization and...Calm. I start every morning with a daily calm session and it gets my head and my heart on the right track every time. 

I also find the breath buble, sleep stories and the master classes extremely valuable. This app is the best way that I can think of for folks that do not have little to no experience with meditation to get the ball rolling. It’s easy! Change your life. Enjoy 🕉🙏🏼☺️❤️"
994,2019-02-21 19:08:05,4,"It used to be amazing. Then you locked the 7 Days of Calm before I got finished with them. What the heck? They used to all be free. I got three of them completed while they were free. Now I am unable to continue with the seven days, as it taunts me in the app saying “3 of 7 days completed”

Seriously? At least leave the 7 days of calm free as a starter! Used to be 5 stars, until you locked several things that should’ve been left as starters. Will change back to 5 stars when you at the very least make all seven days of calm free again."
995,2018-12-29 03:43:43,5,I want a refund for my subscription. I paid for the year subscription and nothing is unlocked apparently. It is as if I am still just previewing the app. I would have unsubscribed if this was the case. I am not paying an additional fee for each level I want to experience. Isn’t that the purpose of the yearly subscription? Please let me know what I need to do next. Otherwise the app was amazing. I just can’t do anything with it at this point and I annoyed I paid for this.🤬
996,2018-12-03 12:32:23,5,"I was diagnosed with severe anxiety a few years ago. Nothing really helped so I’ve tried everything. I was skeptical of this app at first but during a panic attack I decided to give it a try. By god, it helped ground me like nothing before! It’s not a one time fixes all, of course. But it trains you. It trains you over the course of 7 days for 12 minutes each.
Honestly, if you are having trouble mentally give it a shot. Your mental health is worth it! Good luck to everyone out there ❤️"
997,2018-07-15 23:35:19,5,"Honestly I had never really meditated before but I was always curious given that it seemed to bring such peace of mind. I didn’t know how and didn’t think I had the patience but the meditations were short so I thought I might as well give it a try. Since I started using calm I have had so much more focus, emotional resilience and yes calm. I am only about 3 weeks in but I would definitely recommend this to anyone just trying to quiet their mind a bit and find some peace."
998,2018-11-12 23:42:31,1,"Seriously only a seven day free trial. How are you supposed to tell if this works only buy seven days? Why should something that supposed to be relaxing in calling and help people be almost $70 a year? Isn’t it supposed to help people? Typically people who have stresses and Exide he and can’t find happiness in their life is because they can’t afford apps like this that can make them happy. They can’t afford the things in life that will make them stress for your free. Like groceries, Television, Internet, and other things that you say you should be appreciative for. How can you even appreciate it if you can’t even afford it and this app was a charge you $70 to be able to realize that you should appreciate it!"

I was skeptical that meditation could help, it’s been so fantastic. If you give it an honest try, it really can help. I have my husband to thank for suggesting it. 

My only complaint with the app is that I’m constantly having to restore purchases and remind this app that I’m a subscriber. It seems to forget that I subscribe and locks everything out. It’s a little bit irritating."
