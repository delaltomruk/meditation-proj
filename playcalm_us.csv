I bought calm one year ago to try it and started on the winni the pooh series simply because it's a calming things I can think of and it's easy and seemed sweet, it was so gentle and easy to understand, and went in deeper with more meditating and even the sleep meditation. I am a huge fan of calm and love it. Highly recommend.",5,0,4.16,2019-12-04 00:07:30,,
